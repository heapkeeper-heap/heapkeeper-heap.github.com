<pre class="postbody">When the `enew` hkshell command is called, on Windows we create post
files with only \n (=LF=0A) and not \r\n (=CRLF=0D0A) in them, which
will be shown incorrectly by e.g. notepad. If the users copy and paste
the example post files from the browser and insert it, it will contain
CRLF, which is handled, so Hk will work. But it is not a good user
experience I guess to see rectangles instead of newlines.

The interesting thing is that if we modify the post in hkshell (e.g.
with sS), and save it, it will contain CRLF -- which I certainly did
not expect. The reason is that os.write, which is used in the initial
post creation, writes only LF for os.write('\n'), while the function
that writes the post to the disk calls the `write` method of the file
object, which writes CRLF for f.write('\n') (on Windows).

I'm not even 100% sure what is the right solution.
a) If we use LF all the time, it won't work for Windows users, who
will put CRLF-s when editing the post files anyway.
b) If we use CRLF all the time, that will be hard to handle on Unix.
c) We haven't even mentioned OS X which uses only CR.
d) If we use the native EOL on all systems, the syncronization of the
posts will be messy. Although version control systems are used to this
situation, and can handle it; using native EOLs is even their
preferred way of doing things. The installer of the non-cygwin Windows
version of git [1] asks which EOL behaviour to use; using CRLF is the
default.

So I guess we should go with (d). Actually, that is also the easiest
for us to handle; we just have to write a wrapper around os.write. Or
we may even get away without it -- it is very probable that someone
else already wrote it for us.

has a canonical solution. Do you know what it is? If not, we should
seek contact with other programmers and/or have a look at other

We should make the Post class to respect the native newlines of the
OS.

This would mean for example newline conversion when reading and
writing post bodies. I think internally we should store only LF
characters so that other Heapkeeper code does not have to care about
what kind of newline to handle.
