&lt;&lt;&lt;!deltext I haven't looked at all distributed issue trackers yet,
but since we talked about this subject today, I decided to send this
email anyway.&gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt;todo I had no idea how to format some of the paragraphs nicely so
that they will be nice both in email and later in HTML. We should
review this post when having more experience.&gt;&gt;&gt;

== Motivation ==

It would be nice to use an issue tracking system that lets us work
offline as git does.

I don't have to talk about the merits of distributed (and offline) issue
tracking. But I have to mention its disadvantages:
- It will be harder for the users to send bugs. On the other hand, I
 think most users want to send bugs on the mailing list anyway,
 because they are not sure if it is indeed a bug.
- The issue tracker is updated only when we push. I don't think that's
 an important problem though.

== Articles on the subject ==

I have found various resources that talk about DITs (Distributed Issue
Trackers).

Offline Issue Tracking [1]:

   A blog entry. The author mentions TicGit, Git-issues and Ditz.

Distributed bug tracking [2]:

   An article from May 2008. The author mentions Bugs Everywhere,
   ticgit, Scmbug, DisTract, DITrack, and Ditz.

A lists of distributed issue trackers [3]:

   A plain list with a few notes. Mentions 13 DITS.

Distributed bug tracking [4]:

   An article from April 2008. The author mentions Fossil, Bugs
   Everywhere, DITrack, DisTract, TicGit and Ditz.

Ditz versus Bugs Everywhere [5]

   Comparison of Ditz and Bugs Everywhere. Interesting article.

== Features ==

Important features:
- Generating HTML pages from the issue database, so that we can push
 it to our homepage (it shows the users where are we heading, and it
 also shows the maturity of the project).
- Issues should have tags, just like posts on the heap. This would
 replace the current hierarchy of the Todo file.

Nice-to-have features:
- Easily readable and editable issue database. E.g. Ditz stores every
 issue in a YAML file.

== Concrete tools ==

=== Feasible options ===

All tools that are in this category support git. They either support
git explicitly or are VCS agnostic. All of them have clean command
line interfaces. None of them has a comprehensive documentation; at
most they have a good tutorial.

Note: sometimes one item is both under "Pros" and "Misc". The reason
is I wanted the language, repository and database format to be in the
Misc section; but I also wanted to show which ones are pros.

==== Bugs Everywhere (git, bazaar, mercurial, rcs, arch) ====

Homepage:
   <a href="http://bugseverywhere.org/be/show/HomePage">http://bugseverywhere.org/be/show/HomePage</a>

Pros:
   - Used to be the leading project in this niche.
   - Written in Python.

Cons:
   - "perhaps abandonware, last commit was July 2007" -- [4] (in April 2008)
   - "The Ditz mailing list is really active with people debating
     ideas for new features. The be mailing list is now showing some
     signs of life after looking dead in August." [5] (in Dec 2008)

Misc:
   - Written in Python.
   - The project uses Bazaar.

==== TicGit ====

Homepage with tutorial screenshots:
   <a href="http://wiki.github.com/schacon/ticgit">http://wiki.github.com/schacon/ticgit</a>

Pros:
   - Seems easy to use and has a nice tutorial.
   - Issues may have tags.
   - Hosted by GitHub.

Cons:
   - Git-Issues a "better version" of TicGit.
   - The tool was implemented between March and May of 2008; it isn't
     very active now.

Misc:
   - Written in Ruby.
   - Hosted by GitHub.
   - I haven't managed to find out how the issue database is stored.

=== Git-Issues ===

Homepage with examples:
   <a href="http://github.com/jwiegley/git-issues/tree/master">http://github.com/jwiegley/git-issues/tree/master</a>

Pros:
   - "It replicates the functionality of packages like ticgit, but
     does so in the form of a more standalone Python script. You can
     check this script in along with your project in order to ensure
     that all contributors are able to view the bug database using
     the same version of the script that you used to create them".
   - Active project since May 2008. Has a major and quite a few minor
     contributors [6].
   - Issues may have tags.
   - Written in Python.
   - Hosted by GitHub.

Cons:
   - I could not find how to modify a ticket without having to edit
     the XML file that stores it. Even though the homepage states the
     following: "Note that for any XML haters out there, youâ€™ll never
     have to look at this data."

Misc:
   - Written in Python.
   - Hosted by GitHub.
   - The issue database is stored in XML.

==== Ditz ====

Pages:
   - Homepage with screenshots: <a href="http://ditz.rubyforge.org/">http://ditz.rubyforge.org/</a>
   - HTML generated from the issue database: <a href="http://ditz.rubyforge.org/ditz/">http://ditz.rubyforge.org/ditz/</a>
   - Ditz Commander (GUI): <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ditz-commander/">http://code.google.com/p/ditz-commander/</a>

Pros:
   - The source code of the Ditz project is stored in git.
   - Can generate HTML page from issues.
   - "The Ditz mailing list is really active with people debating
     ideas for new features." [5]
   - There is a GUI which can be used to browse and edit the tickets.

Misc:
   - Written in Ruby.
   - Hosted by Gitorious.
   - The issue database is stored in YAML.
   - Last commit was in March 2009.

=== Not feasible options ===

They don't support git.

- Fossil -- a version control system with integrated bug tracker
- DITrack -- subversion only
- DisTract -- monotone VCS only

=== Haven't looked at them ===

- Scmbug (glues together VCS and other bug tracking software, such as
 bugzilla)
- bartman's git-case (git)
- Stick (git)
- cil (Command-line issue tracker with some git integration for closing
 bugs on commit)
- dbug

== Conclusion ==

I don't think Bugs Everywhere is the right solution. I think one of
Git-Issues and Ditz will be the winner. Git-issues does not support
HTML generation; Ditz does not support tags. I lean a bit towards
git-issues: maybe we can write a small module that generates web pages
from the XML files that make up the issue database. If only they used
YAML... But we should definitely try out both before we make a
decision.

We should have a look at the other DITs,  but they were mentioned only
on [3] (with the exception of Scmbug), so they are probably even more
immature then the four I talked about.
