<pre class="postbody">Today, I played with the idea of what Heapkeeper would look like in the eyes
of a newcomer. To simulate this situation, I cloned our git repository into a
fresh directory, added our config file, but nothing else, and started hkshell.
No problems so far. Then, I did a 'dl()'. OK, some messages were downloaded.
Then, a 'ga()' resulted in an exception complaining no sections were provided.

This hints an error in the hkcustomlib, which I later found and corrected
(commit e1bd606b7c, 2009-04-28 16:15).

The cautious reader might have wondered why the cautious wording in the above:
"some messages were downloaded". This is the bigger problem. Right now, we
occasionally log into the heap's GMail account, and archive old messages so
that they are no longer checked for when downloading (as only Inbox is
checked).

Of course, our way of using Heapkeeper includes versioning the heap with a
distributed VCS like Git. So, our hypothetical neophyte would have to
git-clone the post files (i.e. the heap itself) from its official source.

Question is: do things already work the way we want them on a longer
term, or is this just a stopgap solution? (Very probably we'll get
this answer when we'll be moving on to the Web phase.)

</span></span>It is just a stopgap solution. It works OK for us now, and we have
other priorities (documentation, rounding edges). Plus, we don't have
a server that could solve our problem; see later.

== User types ==

I don't think what you described is a problem. We can have 3 kinds of
users:

1. Users whom we know and trust and want to join our heap. No problem
   there, they can use our heap just as we do, we can share the
   ums.heap@gmail.com password with them.
2. Users whom we don't know and want to use Hk for their own heap
   with their own friends, the same way we do. They can use a git
   repository the same way we do. It is not very convenient, but it is
   usable; and Hkweb would not improve their situation a lot with
   regards to the repository/server situation.
3. Users who want to use a public heap. They either want us to publish
   HH so they do not have to create a new heap and they can talk to us
   on our normal communication channel. Or maybe they want to have an
   own public heap. This is the problem: Hk and our practices are not
   able to manage a public heap.

Your original problem is not realistic. It assumes that we share the
GMail password of ums.heap@gmail.com with the new user. If we trust
him/her that much, he/she can certainly pull from the git repos on our
machines, so the initial dl()-thing is not a problem.

== Public heap ==

We could think about what do we need for a public heap. What is a
public heap anyway? My best answer as of now: the essence of a public
heap is a public git repository and a service that listens to a
mailing list and converts new emails to posts and pushes them to the
repository. Human maintainers could have access to the repository and
maintain it; other collaborators could made improvements in their own
heap and ask the maintainers to pull from them. Actually, this would
require very little programming and configuration work. The big
problem: this would require a server on which we can run a git server
and python 24 hours a day.

On the top of the public heap I described, we could have Hkweb running
so that people don't have to interact with git and python, just their
browser. But that is a totally different question and not the subject of
the current thread.
