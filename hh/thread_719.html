There is one more thing that might strike others as a strong sign of
immaturity: exceptions. Due to the way we implemented an interactive
interface in Python, the user is bound to encounter Python tracebacks
quite often, and these may be confusing to the casual user. Even if
the exception message is sensible and helpful, it is lost in the
jumble.

A page I found [1] says to turn off tracebacks, just set
`sys.tracebacklimit` to 0.

True.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Due to the way we implemented an interactive interface in Python,

</span></span>
We could catch them if we wanted to. But currently we don't. (The
project is immature :) )

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; and these may be confusing to the casual user.
</span></span>
True.

You don't know in advance which line of the stack trace helps.
Sometimes it sits in the middle.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; A page I found [1] says to turn off tracebacks, just set
&gt; `sys.tracebacklimit` to 0.
</span></span>
Interesting.

But I don't want to do that. Even if users don't want to see
exceptions, they are useful for developers if they are sent to them.
What I want to do at some point is to write the uncaught exceptions
into an error log file. When a "casual" users got errors and do not
understand why, they can look at the error log file, and if they don't
understand even that, they can send it to us and ask.

We should not throw away any information regarding the exception. It
is OK to turn off printing all the stack trace only if we make sure it
gets written somewhere else. But in that case, we should not use
"sys.tracebacklimit = 0", but instead catch the exception, write it to
the error log and print out something sensible to the user (e.g. "An
error occured: 'x does not have attribute y'. See errorlog.23 for the
complete stack trace.").

I don't have any motivation to do that now, I like the stack traces
being printed on the console [1]. The only problem is that when users
see them, they feel that the database may get corrupted, which
fortunately cannot be done without manipulating the database itself.
(I.e. you cannot corrupt the database by using post sets, generators,
the shell etc. incorrectly.) So this could motivate us to implement
the user friendly error message and the error log files, and turn them
on by default, with the possibility of printing stack traces to the
console instead.

All that said: it is _our_ project, so if you want to do it, go ahead,
and make an option for this.

[1] I don't like _when_ they are printed, but I like _the fact_ that
they are printed :)

<pre class="post-body-content">So, to sum up your opinion: you agree that tracebacks may, and
probably would be seen is a sign of immaturity, but you find them
useful, so you want to keep them.

OK. But how about defaulting to no tracebacks, and provide an option
for the developers to enable them? Then you, I and any other willing
contributors who may find us could benefit from the detailed
tracebacks at the expense of adding one line to our hkrc, which would
always be customized, anyway.

A Lem short story comes to my mind. A king asks Trurl, the great
engineer, to build the perfect counselor. The king, when the robot
counselor is presented to him, immediately criticizes it, because it
doesn't obey the commands he was thinking. Then, the robot gives him a
key which enables its telepathic capabilities, because, it explains,
otherwise, the robot would trespass its master's thoughts without
permission, which a perfect counselor won't do. (Similarly our project
could start out with the potentially disturbing features switched
off.)

</span></span>
An example:

<span class="raw-block">	&gt;&gt;&gt; p('no')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "&lt;console&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hkshell.py", line 1049, in p
		postset = postdb().postset(pp)
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hklib.py", line 1133, in postset
		return PostSet(self, posts)
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hklib.py", line 1610, in __init__
		super(PostSet, self).__init__(PostSet._to_set(postdb, posts))
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hklib.py", line 1642, in _to_set
		return PostSet._to_set(postdb, [prepostset])
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hklib.py", line 1649, in _to_set
		post = postdb.post(prepost, True)
	  File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hklib.py", line 1156, in post
		return self.heapid_to_post[heapid]
	KeyError: 'no'
</span>
You can see that the output consists of 2 parts: the traceback first,
then, in one line, the exception message. I think that for most
users, this last line would be sufficient. So, what the user would see
without tracebacks enabled:

<span class="raw-block">	&gt;&gt;&gt; p('no')
	KeyError: 'no'
</span>
Though not the best possible error message here, it is not as
frightening to the uninitiated as the traceback.
