<pre class="postbody">I ran across this:

<a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ch05.html">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/ch05.html</a>

It seems a nice document. It starts explaining Git history manipulation like
this:

    A consequence of Git’s distributed nature is that history can be edited
    easily.  But if you tamper with the past, take care: only rewrite that part
    of history which you alone possess. Just as nations forever argue over who
    committed what atrocity, if someone else has a clone whose version of
    history differs to yours, you will have trouble reconciling when your trees
    interact.

    Of course, if you control all the other trees too, then there is no problem
    since you can overwrite them.

    Some developers strongly feel history should be immutable, warts and all.
    Others feel trees should be made presentable before they are unleashed in
    public. Git accommodates both viewpoints. Like cloning, branching and
    merging, rewriting history is simply another power Git gives you. It is up
    to you to use it wisely.

My thoughts on this:
- a nice simile
- all your tree are belong to us [1]
- if one has bad thoughts about altering the purity of the past (not
  out of considering adverse effects, but simply out of knowing it to
  be a Bad Thing to Do (TM)), interest in using or developing Heapkeeper
  is to be reconsidered

However, if we choose to alter history now to sort out multiple
personality issues may have a compelling effect for the future. If we
get caught in a craving for a tidy repository, we'll sooner or later
be inclined to clean up the "motorway sections" by rebasing them. Now
we could do it. Once we have "followers" (either in the quoted or the
literal sense), we can't. By (hopefully) gaining attention with the
launch of the homepage, we, so to say, 'set up us the bomb', so we had
better 'make our time' (um, sorry; what I want to say is we should do
all our history-changing now while we control all copies of the source
tree).

`git rebase -i`, that is, interactive rebase, seems very powerful. Have you
ever used it?

I remember some official github guide on history editing. I'll go and check

</span></span>I don't want to do things like this after 0.3 is released. For me
that's like going to public.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I remember some official github guide on history editing. I'll go and check
&gt; that one out.

</span></span>Do that. I haven't found anything, except for this: [2]

I have also been playing around in a sandbox repo. In the sandbox, I
tried to rewrite the history and push the new one [3].

The conclusion is: it seems to me that we have no way of doing what we
want to do except for deleting and re-creating the heapkeeper
repository.

== Heapkeeper-tidy ==

I did exactly that with another sandbox. I pushed the repository you
sent into my second sandbox repo on github [4]. Pushing all commits of
the last 10 months was so fast that I thought something must be wrong.
But as it turns out, it worked. The impact graph contains only two
people, and everything else seems to work fine. The non-master
branches are lost, but they could have been pushed just as easily if
the tidied up repository contained them. We can also use patches to
introduce them, see in the next section.

The tags are also lost, which made me think that we should not just
put them to the same place, because that would cause the descriptions
on the download page look as ugly as they are now [5]. We could place
new commits which would only change the README and whose commit
message would say something like this:

    Heapkeeper version 0.1

    This release is a propotype.

    Features:

    - Downloading emails over IMAP.
    - Storing posts in individual files.
    - Generating threaded index page that contains all posts.

What do you say?

== Creating and applying patches ==

Then I wanted to solve my problem of having worked on files yesterday,
which were not of course in your repository tidied up. I had 5 commits
in my own repo that I wanted to introduce into the new repository. It
was surprisingly easy: I just had to create a bunch of patches in my
old repository and apply them in the new one. The patches even contain
log message and author information.

In my current heapkeeper repository:

    # Create patches for commits since origin/master:
    $ git format-patch origin/master
    0001-hklib-don-t-crash-if-nicknames-is-missing.patch
    0002-CodConv-docstrings-for-functions-and-classes.patch
    0003-heapindex.css-margin-narrowed.patch
    0004-Tutorial-Using-a-mailing-list-added.patch
    0005-Tutorial-screenshots-recreated.patch
    $ ls | grep patch
    0001-hklib-don-t-crash-if-nicknames-is-missing.patch
    0002-CodConv-docstrings-for-functions-and-classes.patch
    0003-heapindex.css-margin-narrowed.patch
    0004-Tutorial-Using-a-mailing-list-added.patch
    0005-Tutorial-screenshots-recreated.patch

In the new heapkeeper repository ($Hk is the old repo; don't bother
with the "whitespace error"):

    # Applying patch 1
    $ git am $Hk/0001-hklib-don-t-crash-if-nicknames-is-missing.patch
    Applying: hklib: don't crash if 'nicknames' is missing

    # Applying the other 4 patches
    $ git am $Hk/0002-CodConv-docstrings-for-functions-and-classes.patch \
    &gt;        $Hk/0003-heapindex.css-margin-narrowed.patch \
    &gt;        $Hk/0004-Tutorial-Using-a-mailing-list-added.patch \
    &gt;        $Hk/0005-Tutorial-screenshots-recreated.patch
    Applying: CodConv: docstrings for functions and classes
    /a/cp/hk/hk-tidy/heapkeeper-tidy/.git/rebase-apply/patch:43: trailing whitespace.

    warning: 1 line adds whitespace errors.

== Further changes ==

- Adding tags in the way I described.
- Do you want to do something with your 'bodyparsing' and 'minimal'
  branches? Or let's just leave them for now and you can use the
  patch-technique to introduce them at any time?

<pre class="postbody"><span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; My question is: once you show all those people what we have, will they
&gt;&gt; see what it is good for?
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; That's a question for another thread I think.

</span></span>I'm never afraid to start a thread in another one... though it is
laborous to separate them later, especially if the two have been
running in parallel in several posts. But in another thread, then.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; But do you think it
&gt;&gt; is a limitation of github or git? I mean, that we can't just push a
&gt;&gt; totally rewritten repository.
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; I think it's git.

</span></span>A little bit of heartbreak over there.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; So, we'd hard-reset, edit README, commit, tag and rebase for both
&gt;&gt; 0.1 and 0.2, if I understand correctly.
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; Yes, that is what I thought, but it does not seem to work because of
&gt; the motorway.

</span></span>Umm... both the 0.1 and 0.2 tags are on "single sections". Will that
still cause a problem with motorways coming after the tag? I think
I'll go and experiment with it.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-3">&gt;&gt;&gt; == Further changes ==

</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Why isn't minimal merged into master?

</span></span>That is the middle of the Chaos of May 2009. Minimal is now at a merge
of a merge of a merge and something else and something else
(literally), and I guess I didn't dare to merge the merge back into
master. I think the best way to save the minimal branch would be to
start off from before the chaos and cherry-pick the necessary changes
to form a new minimal, then throw the old one away.

</span></span>I tried it. The problem is the rebase tries to linearize everything,
all the motorways that are present in the history back until 0.1/0.2.
There are also merge conflicts: usually those that conflicted for us
back then, but it seems that there are other conflicts as well, which
are not automatically resolved now. (Maybe git rebase uses a different
merge algorithm than git merge uses by default?) It would be a few
hours I think to do that: it would mean linearizing all our history.

We have three options:
1. Do the linearization.
2. Try another mechanism, e.g. git filter.
3. Put back v0.1 and v0.2 tags as they were and do work that actually
   matters :)

</span></span>Option 3 is of course attractive, but learning Git is fun _and_
matters, so I think I'll try and read about rebasing with preserving
loops.

</span></span>Yes, it can be a problem.

This search:

    egrep -l "commit.*[0-9a-f]{4,}"

turns up 40 posts. If that's all, we can handle that.
