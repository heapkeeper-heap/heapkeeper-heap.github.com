<pre class="postbody">I propose the following roadmap (which will not be set in stone of
course).

- New Generator:
    - Reviewing/understanding the new Generator //Attis
    - Discussing the new Generator //Attis &amp; Csabi
    - Extending or modifying during and after the discussion
      //Attis &amp; Csabi
    - Remove the old Generator //Csabi (or Attis)
- Releasing Hk v0.4 //Csabi
- Implementing support for post references (required for separating
  UMS and Hh) [1] //Csabi
- Going through the heap and correct all post references so that Hk
  understands them
    - Hk-related posts (with or without "hh" tag): Csabi
    - other posts: Attis
- Implementing support for multiple heaps [2] //Csabi
- Separating UMS and Hh with an automated process and check the result
  carefully //Attis &amp; Csabi
- Making Hh public:
    - setting up a public mailing list for Hh //Attis or Csabi
    - setting up a github repo for Hh //Attis or Csabi
    - setting up Shrek to make automatic commits of new posts //Attis
- Releasing Hk v0.5 and announcing Hk to the world //Csabi

We can implement smaller things on the way, of course, and during the
cleanup we can do more then just correcting the post references. I
want to refresh my memory and sort the Hk-related posts (we will see
how that goes).

You can work even on something bigger (hkweb for instance). Also, we
may do things paralel and may have branches in the repository: maybe
we will implement support for post references while still having
discussions about the new Generator.

Do you have ideas about what do you want to work on?

I think we should make a "0.4" branch and a "0.5" branch. Stuff that
concerns the new generator and smaller fixes should go into 0.4. Hkweb
and support for multiple heaps should go into branch 0.5. Eventually,
when the old generator is removed from 0.4, we should release it, and
merge or rebase it with 0.5.

&gt; concerns the new generator and smaller fixes should go into 0.4. Hkweb
&gt; and support for multiple heaps should go into branch 0.5. Eventually,

&gt; merge or rebase it with 0.5.

</span></span>I think it is time now to prepare for releasing 0.4.

About the branches: let's stay with master, _master and the topic
branches for now. (master and _master are practically the
unmodifiable/modifiable versions of the branch called "0.4" that I
proposed.) I don't think we should create a 0.5 branch, the topic
branches are better instead. (We don't know yet which of
hkweb/multiple heaps/blog/etc. will we include in 0.5.)

Things we have to do before the release:
- Remove the old generator and modify hkshell to use the new one.
  //Csabi
- Try the new code. //Attis, Csabi
- Modify the tutorial and other documentation (e.g. the Architecture
  page). //Csabi

I will create a new branch called "_old_gen_removed" which removes the
new generator and write an email when I pushed it. If is works, we
should merge it into _master/master, and we should rebase all other
branches on it. Then we can announce "feature freeze" for ourselves :)
We wait for one or two weeks before releasing 0.4, so we may catch
some errors. [1] Then we do the release.

What do you think?

<span class="meta-text">[timeout 1 week]</span>

[1] I proposed rebasing everything on _old_gen_removed because this
    way we might catch errors in the following weeks even if we use
    other branches like _hkweb, _blog, etc.
