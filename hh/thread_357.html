<pre class="post-body-content">Motivation: have you ever had the feeling on a mailing list that
people use jargon that you don't understand? For example, Python
developers often talk about "the GIL", and I didn't understand it. [1]

I'm sure we will have our own jargon -- Hk, HH, and I would like
to use "bs" for "bracket segment". We could have a mechanism that
finds these words in posts and converts them to links that point to
their explanation. This way when people read any of our posts, it
will be easy for them to understand what we are talking about. We
could link words like "hkshell" and "hkrc", as well; so we could
easily say to anyone that "put this in your hkrc" without further
explanation.

It could be implemented as a body parser plugin. (A "processor" in my
terminology.)

[1] Now I googled it up, and it is "Global Interpreter Lock".

It would be great! Such ideas make me remember how important it would
be to have a decent body parsing feature.
