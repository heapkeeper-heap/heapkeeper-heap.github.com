<pre class="post-body-content">I propose removing out hkrc files from the Heapkeeper repository.

We added them for two reasons:
1. So that we can copy stuff from each other's hkrc.
2. So that we can maintain each other's hkrcs when we modify something.

I don't do the first one, and you cannot do it either, because I don't
put my own stuff into my hkrc that is in the repository (because it is
ugly and messy). Regarding the second one: in my experience, this
system is not good but bad for the maintainability. (E.g. I would
boldly remove any dead code from Heapkeeper; but it would feel weird
to remove the dead code from your hkrc. And this applies to every
possible improvement. For example now pylint found errors in your hkrc
("import datetime" is missing but datetime is used).) Our deprecation
system means that everyone can correct and adjust their own hkrc files
to the changes in Heapkeeper, so point (2) is not that relevant now.

I want to remove my hkrc because I don't want to maintain it. Also, I
don't want to document it. Sometime I want to delete whole parts of it
or reorganize it, and I don't want it to be a Heapkeeper commit. This
not only would increase the number of commits unnecessarily, but I
would also have to deal with it when merging the branches. (An ideal
way of working is if the different feature branches (that are about
different features) touch different modules, which will make merge
easy; but hkrcs could be modified in all of them.)

I removed both of our hkrc files in commit d4cde17 [1].
