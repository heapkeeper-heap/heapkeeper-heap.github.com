I already removed the Reference attribute in Heapkeeper v0.5 (commit
5a7e03e573), but I haven't closed this thread because I know Attis has
objections.

I would like to modify my opinion. Now I think that it would be useful
to have an "Original-parent" header attribute. The reason is that with
normal threads, Heapkeeper would be able to determine which quote
belongs to whom. For example if we have the following thread:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Susan: Nice robot

        Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run away!

      &lt;2&gt; Peter: Nice robot

          &gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
          &gt; away!

          Thanks!

        &lt;3&gt; Alfred: Nice robot

            &gt;&gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
            &gt;&gt; away!

            I don't think it is that nice...
</span>
then Heapkeeper would be able to determine that the quote in post 3
originated from post 1. E.g. it could have a feature to add the
author's name before each quote, which could even be a link to the
original post:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;3&gt; Alfred: Nice robot

        [Susan &lt;usr/1&gt;]
        &gt;&gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
        &gt;&gt; away!

        I don't think it is that nice...
</span>
This could work until post 2 is marked as the parent of post 3. But
sometimes we break threads because the topic changes significantly
between a parent and a child, and we want the thread view of
Heapkeeper to show them as separate threads. It would be good even in
those cases to provide Heapkeeper with the information that the quotes
in post 3 are originated from post 2.

So now I propose adding an "Original-parent" header attribute. But I
still don't propose having a "Reference" attribute.

I agree.

However, what you are planning would work only if the maintainer of
the heap never adds or removes posts to/from a subthread. A situation
where automatic identification of original authors may be a problem:

&lt;1&gt; Alfred: Chess?

<span class="raw-block">        Anyone for chess tomorrow night?

    &lt;2&gt; Peter: Party tomorrow

            Please don't forget that the annual USR Party will be held
            tomorrow evening.

        &lt;3&gt; Peter: Party tomorrow

                [note Almost forgot...]

                &gt; Please don't forget that the annual USR Party will be held
                &gt; tomorrow evening.

                Appropriate attire required!

                [todo join this to parent]

            &lt;4&gt; Susan: Party tomorrow
</span>
                    &gt;&gt; Please don't forget that the annual USR Party
will be held
                    &gt;&gt; tomorrow evening.

<span class="raw-block">                    Oh, almost forgot.

                    &gt; Appropriate attire required!

                    What do you mean?
</span>
Now if the maintainer obeys what Peter asks in post 3, xe will also
have to modify the quote depth in post 4, otherwise the first quote
will be attributed to Alfred, while the real author is Peter.

To handle this semi-automatically, we should introduce the concept of
a valid quote. A valid n-depth quote contains lines which can be found
in the nth ancestor of the post unquoted. We could check quotes, and
warn if a change introduces new invalid quotes. So, if the maintainer
copies text from post 3 to post 2, nothing happens; but when xe
changes post 4's parent to 2, the first quote in post 4 becomes
invalid.

When maintaining, I never reflow quotes. So, if someone sends a post
like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt; Unnecessary sentence. This is
    &gt; what we really want to
    &gt; quote. This is not needed.

    This is my reply.
</span>
and I want to make the post more readable by decreasing the amount of
quotes, I do this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt; This is
    &gt; what we really want to
    &gt; quote.

    This is my reply.
</span>
If the maintainer does this, deciding if a quote is valid is easy.
Otherwise, we will have to pay attention to whitespace issues.
