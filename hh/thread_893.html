I know what you are talking about...

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; The open-close system tries to solve this problem for the issue

</span></span>
<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Do you experience this problem? Do you think we should do something
&gt; about this? If yes, do you have any ideas?
</span></span>
Yes, I think so. Maybe we could have a number of states for non-issue
threads:
- "closed": the question has been answered, the proposition discussed,
  the recommended content viewed, and no further comments are needed,
  but of course, if someone wishes to, xe can revive the thread [1]
- "open": the thread is not closed, so response is still expected
- "asleep": the thread was open for a long enough time to assume that
  the expected response will not occur in the foreseeable future; of
  course, this is not to discourage anyone finding this thread in the
  archive and willing to continue it

One situation not covered here would be when a thread is open, but
it loses its actuality due to any reason, e.g. it is a question about
a code fragment that has become rewritten. I don't know if we simply
should close such threads or mark them somehow differently, e.g.
"timeout".

Do you have any other ideas? Also, what do you think of my state
ideas?

[1] This practice is called "thread necromancy", and frown upon in
    many forums, but I think it is totally acceptable in our heaps.

That's basically a bit more advanced system than the current issue
system. But maybe you are right and improving the current issue system
is the only way to deal with this.

We talked about new role of the "idea" tag before [1], that seems to
be the answer. So in hh, everything that may need action should be
issue. If we are not sure that it needs an action or not sure about
which action to take, the issue is an "idea".

It's a different question to have something like this on UMS. But
a modified version of hh's issue system will be fine there.

Opinions?

I think the comparison to the "star system" of e-mail clients is
useful. There is one difference, though. Stars, folders and such are
unilateral. I star a mail, and it will be starred only for me, the
other party will have no idea if I consider that thread closed.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; That's basically a bit more advanced system than the current issue
&gt; system. But maybe you are right and improving the current issue system
&gt; is the only way to deal with this.
</span></span>
But only a bit, as there is one new state, "asleep". This state can be
thought of as an alternate version of "close": the effect is the same,
but threads ending with "close" and "asleep" should be displayed
differently.

There is but one problem with this: if someone "wakes up" a sleeping
thread by posting to it, xe must add an "open" tag, otherwise, it'll
remain in the "asleep" state. And since the maintainer of the heap
adds this tag to the Heap post, it will not be visible in the
answerer's e-mail client.

This means that the "asleep" state should have special semantics. A
thread is in "asleep" state iff:
- the thread is not closed AND
- either:
    - the newest post is older than a given age, OR
    - all the "endpoints" of the thread have the "asleep" tag or meta

(By "endpoints" I mean posts that have no children.)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; We talked about new role of the "idea" tag before [1], that seems to
&gt; be the answer. So in hh, everything that may need action should be
&gt; issue. If we are not sure that it needs an action or not sure about
&gt; which action to take, the issue is an "idea".
</span></span>
To sum up [1] here: you propose that "idea" should not be an issue
type by itself, but rather a flag that expresses the author is not
convinced about the usefulness or feasibility of the proposal.

I don't see how this would be related to the problem of old threads
falling asleep. (Though I have a strange reflection [2].)

</span></span>
Just to clarify: later in this post you propose a solution which
would _not_ work like this.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; This means that the "asleep" state should have special semantics. A
&gt; thread is in "asleep" state iff:
&gt; - the thread is not closed AND
&gt; - either:
&gt;     - the newest post is older than a given age, OR
&gt;     - all the "endpoints" of the thread have the "asleep" tag or meta
</span></span>
I think we should add another condition. I don't think it is a good
idea to send _any_ thread asleep that has not been touched e.g. for a
few months. If there is a bug or issue on hh, it should not disappear
from the issue tracker just because it's old. It will get in the lower
part of the HTML page that lists the issues, that's enough for me.

There are other kinds of threads, however, which should go to sleep
when nobody touched them for a while. Interestingly, these are mostly
threads with "idea" tags.

So I modified your proposal:

<span class="raw-block">    A thread is in "asleep" state iff:
    - the thread is an "idea" thread AND
    - the thread is not closed AND
    - either:
        - the newest post is older than a given age, OR
        - all the "endpoints" of the thread have the "asleep" tag or
          meta
</span>
It can be refined if you think that the "idea" tag is not perfect for
this use. We could say that "idea" threads are sleepy by default but
can be made "non-sleepy" with the "non-sleepy" tag, and non-"idea"
threads are non-sleepy by default, but can be made sleepy with the
"sleepy" tag.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; (By "endpoints" I mean posts that have no children.)
</span></span>
We can also call them "leaves" if we follow the terminology of
"computer science trees" that we introduced with names like "root",
"parent" and "child".

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; We talked about new role of the "idea" tag before [1], that seems to
&gt;&gt; be the answer. So in hh, everything that may need action should be
&gt;&gt; issue. If we are not sure that it needs an action or not sure about
&gt;&gt; which action to take, the issue is an "idea".
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; To sum up [1] here: you propose that "idea" should not be an issue
&gt; type by itself, but rather a flag that expresses the author is not
&gt; convinced about the usefulness or feasibility of the proposal.
</span></span>
Exactly.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I don't see how this would be related to the problem of old threads
&gt; falling asleep. (Though I have a strange reflection [2].)
</span></span>
Sincerely, I have no idea (no pun intended) what I meant either. But
in this post, I described an idea (no pun intended) that relates
"idea" tags and "sleeping" threads.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; It's a different question to have something like this on UMS. But
&gt;&gt; a modified version of hh's issue system will be fine there.
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; What do you think about this idea?
</span></span>
I think we are fine without any issue system on UMS. On the other
hand, we need it a lot on hh, so when the issue system on hh is mature
enough, we can adapt it to UMS.

hcs42: hi
attis: hello
attis: I think we should clarify our ideas on the threads-falling-asleep feature.
attis: especially how it'd be related to the issue tracker
attis: I imagine that the "asleep-tracking" would be below, and it would affect all threads
attis: but the asleep state would be off for threads marked as "non-sleepy" and for issues
attis: if we do so, we could use the same system on both heaps
attis: you argued that issues shouldn't fall asleep
hcs42: do you mean that we would use the asleep-system on the posts that are _not_ handled by the issue tracker?
hcs42: or do you think that it could be used for "idea" threads?
attis: I'm not so sure now
attis: because it all depends on what we use the asleep state for
attis: if we define the meaning of "asleep" as a warning
attis: like "pay attention, this thread may need attention!"
attis: then it's perfectly OK to use it even for issues
hcs42: (that's the opposite of what I thought asleep threads would be used for)
attis: we mentioned e-mail starring in the first place
attis: and starring means "pay attention to this later"
attis: (there is really no sense in using the asleep state to make threads "go away", they'd default to that, and we want to avoid it)
hcs42: (it may make sense to make old ideas go away from the issue tracker)
hcs42: so
attis: (but then they should be closed appropriately, I think)
hcs42: you did not say it explicitely, but you suggest that a main index page (not necessarily the default index page) that displays all posts should display asleep threads differently
attis: yes, but not that differently; maybe a different color would be enough
hcs42: ok, I got it now
attis: or, we may choose to handle sleeping threads as a kind of "meta-issue" that is to be resolved ASAP to keep the heap and our thoughts clean
hcs42: would the threads be sleepy by default?
attish: 'would the threads be sleepy by default?' -- I guess so
hcs42: I don't like that
attish: why?
hcs42: certainly not on UMS
hcs42: I send a lot of posts that I don't want you to answer
hcs42: I mean... don't expect you to answer
hcs42: like posting news items, humorous pages, interesting thoughts
hcs42: I don't want them to pop out later just because noone commented on them
attish: true
hcs42: on hh, maybe this kind of post is not that common, but the "idea" threads are similar
hcs42: I don't expect anyone to comment idea threads
attish: but that could be handled by posting with a close meta
hcs42: do you propose that when we post e.g. a humorous page, we should include a "close" meta?
hcs42: that seems quite awkward
hcs42: and unintuitive
attish: it does...
attish: how about closing manually such threads?
hcs42: UMS is a mailing list primarily, not an issue tracker
hcs42: even worse
hcs42: I don't want the maintainers to spend time on these posts
hcs42: I just post something funny, you watch it, and that's all
attish: what would you suggest?
hcs42: if you want to find it later, you can -- that's the point of the heap; but I don't have having such overheads
hcs42: do we want to talk about using this on hh, UMS or both?
attish: interesting threads falling asleep bother me
hcs42: because I have different approaches to those heaps
hcs42: hm, that's the source of the problem
hcs42: it does not bother me
attish: ahh
hcs42: so should we concentrate on UMS then?
hcs42: I guess when you say "interesting threads" you mean mostly threads on UMS
attish: yes
attish: it'd be more important on UMS
hcs42: could you give a few examples?
hcs42: to make sure we mean the same thing on "interesting thread"
attish: ok, just a minute
attish: umm
attish: this is strange
attish: almost all the threads I marked as starred are no longer relevant...
attish: my suggestion:
attish: we suspend this discussion
attish: until I've looked through my starred threads
hcs42: ok
attish: and assess how many of those would need resurrection
attish: and then, we'll reconsider if this feature would be useful
hcs42: ok
hcs42: to sum up: when I wrote my root post about "Lost threads", I wanted to address a different problem than you do
