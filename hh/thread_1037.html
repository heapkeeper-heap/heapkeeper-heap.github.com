<pre class="post-body-content">I tried out pylint [1], which is a static analyser tool for Python. It
can be installed by doing "apt-get install pylint".

pylint can warn us when the code does not conform to coding
conventions, when it thinks something should be refactored, or when the
code would raise runtime error because e.g. we use an unassigned
variable. It also finds unused imports. It seems to examine a lot of
things.

It is not as smart as its Erlang counterpart called Dialyser. Dialyser
would do type inference and warn when a function is called wrong types
of arguments. pylint does not warn even for the following:

<span class="raw-block">    def f():
        print

    f(1)
</span>
If you give this code to pylint, you will get 3 warnings: one because
the module does not have a docstring, another because f does not have
a docstring, and a third one because f is too short and function names
should have at least 3 characters according to pylint.

Fortunately it can be controlled which warnings are suppressed:

<span class="raw-block">    $ pylint --output=colorized --reports=n --include-ids=y --disable-msg=C0111 a.py
    No config file found, using default configuration
    ************* Module a
    C0103:  1:f: Invalid name "f" (should match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$)
</span>
The warning code of missing docstring is C0111.

Comments into source code can instruct pylint to suppress warnings:

<span class="raw-block">    # pylint: disable-msg=C0111
    def f():
        # pylint: disable-msg=C0103
        print

    def g():
        print
</span>
The first line instructs it to suppress the "missing documentation"
warning. The third line instructs it to suppress "invalid name", but
it will be applied only for `f`, go we will still get a warning for
`g`. This way we can suppress certain messages either locally or
globally.

After I implemented several heaps and tested it with the automatic
tests, but before I tried it out, I ran pylint, and it found two bugs.
One was that I raised "HkException" instead of "hkutils.HkException",
and the other one was that I forgot to remove an argument from the
argument list of a function. The latter would have been uncovered
during the manual test, but the former would not.

Probably if I used pylint before executing the automatic tests and
correcting the bunch of errors uncovered by them, pylint have found
more errors, and I would have spent less time debugging.

pylint prints this error quite a few time when used on Heapkeeper's
code:

<span class="raw-block">    Exception RuntimeError: 'maximum recursion depth exceeded while
    calling a Python object' in &lt;type 'exceptions.AttributeError'&gt;
    ignored
</span>
It does not exit and still prints warnings, but this is annoying. I
found the entry in the pylint developer's bug tracker [2], so I hope
something will be done about this soon. Until then:

<span class="raw-block">    $ pylint &lt;args&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed '/^Exc/d'
</span>
I have commited the hk_pylint script to hk-dev-utils which contains
this workaround, and instructs pylint to ignore all warning that we
don't care (or at least not for now).

Thanks for this essay.

Don't you have the impression that unit testing is far superior to
what pylint does, and largely makes it unneeded?

Largely, but not completely. I like that pylint tries to force coding
conventions, because it is better to say to fellow developers that
"write it this way because pylint says so" that "write it this way
because I say so". However, it can backfire, if someone wants to do
something because pylint says so and I don't...

Some people think unit tests makes static typing unneeded.

An interesting view!

I've recently began to interpret static typing as a necessary price of
compiled languages, but this is not so. Think BCPL, then think Java:
BCPL is typeless and compiled, Java is statically typed, but
interpreted.

The right way to look at static typing is as a tool of avoiding type
errors. Of course testing can do the same. Question is: does the type
information available in declarations improve code readability?

OK, I haven't read your next sentence carefully enough:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; Question is: does the type
&gt;&gt; information available in declarations improve code readability?
</span></span>
I think it does when you give type information about parameters and
return values.

But, of course, good docstrings are at least as useful -- the only
difference is that docstrings are optional.
