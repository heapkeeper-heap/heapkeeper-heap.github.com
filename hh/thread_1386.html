<pre class="post-body-content">I propose having a new tag called "removal".

Sometimes we want to remove a feature, a file format or just a
function from Heapkeeper. The usual procedure [1][2] is to:
1. Deprecate the functionality in one Heapkeeper version, and make it
   issue warnings when used;
2. Remove it totally from the next Heapkeeper version.

Most of these removals will probably be proposed and discussed on HH.
I think it would be good to have a separate tag for these threads.
(I can imagine that I only want to look at these removal threads, but
I can even more easily imagine that I want to look at only the
non-removal issues.)

Most threads with a "removal" tag would also have an "issue" tag.

I also propose using the "removal" word as a commit topic.

Examples:
- <a href="../hh/thread_972.html#post-summary-hh-972">heap://hh/972</a> (Removing Post.html*)
- <a href="../hh/thread_1102.html#post-summary-hh-1102">heap://hh/1102</a> (Deprecation status of g(), ga() and gi())
- <a href="../hh/thread_1190.html#post-summary-hh-1190">heap://hh/1190</a> (Removing the Reference attribute)
