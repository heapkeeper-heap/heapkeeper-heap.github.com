<pre class="post-body-content">I propose having a new tag called "removal".

Sometimes we want to remove a feature, a file format or just a
function from Heapkeeper. The usual procedure [1][2] is to:
1. Deprecate the functionality in one Heapkeeper version, and make it
   issue warnings when used;
2. Remove it totally from the next Heapkeeper version.

Most of these removals will probably be proposed and discussed on HH.
I think it would be good to have a separate tag for these threads.
(I can imagine that I only want to look at these removal threads, but
I can even more easily imagine that I want to look at only the
non-removal issues.)

Most threads with a "removal" tag would also have an "issue" tag.

I also propose using the "removal" word as a commit topic.

Examples:
- <a href="../hh/thread_972.html#post-summary-hh-972">heap://hh/972</a> (Removing Post.html*)
- <a href="../hh/thread_1102.html#post-summary-hh-1102">heap://hh/1102</a> (Deprecation status of g(), ga() and gi())
- <a href="../hh/thread_1190.html#post-summary-hh-1190">heap://hh/1190</a> (Removing the Reference attribute)

OK, but why not "deprecation"? Most of the time we can't just remove a
feature, we have to mark it for deprecation in order to keep the "API"
stable.

I have to admit, that was the tag I wanted to use first. But the
discussion in these threads would focus on whether the feature should
be removed or not; the deprecation is just a process and a tool to
make the removal less painful. That said, the tag "deprecation" has
advantages as well: most programmers will instantly know what we are
talking about, which is not the case for "removal".

So I can accept "deprecation" if you still think that's better. Do you?

I think this is a strong argument. I vote for "deprecation".

These threads may prove very useful in the future when we begin to
work on a new version and want to see which features have "timed out",
and need to be supported no longer.

<pre class="post-body-content">OK then, let's have "deprecation".

I unfortunately sent a few posts with the "removal" tag, so let's
close this thread only after they have been corrected on the heap.
