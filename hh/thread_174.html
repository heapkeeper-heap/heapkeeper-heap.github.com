It seems to me that body parsing aims to do many things. Because of
this, I propose a modular system where the body parser is handed a
list of parsing modules which are then executed one after another.

<pre class="post-body-content">In the simplest form, such a modular framework does nothing else
besides keeping a list of processing modules and iterating over this
list and call upon all the modules to do their specific processing. In
this model, a processing module is simply a function that takes a
string and returns the complete HTML representation of the body as
another string. Despite its simplicity, most of the tasks we want to
do during the body parsing can be achieved with such a model.

However, what we aim for is more than what this approach can handle,
in at least two ways:
* we need to be able to access the post and the post database, while
parsing the bodies
* the separation of already processed (HTML) and still unprocessed
(raw) parts of the body have to be distinguished

For this, I propose to keep the body throughout the individual stages
of processing in a special structure, which is a list of segments.
Each segment consists of a string and a flag to indicate if that
particular segment is in HTML or in plaintext.

When the processing starts, the framework class puts the whole body
into a single segment. Then, the very first module would break it up
into paragraphs, and add each paragraph as an individual segment into
a new list, with these segments all still flagged as plaintext.

At the end of the pipeline, the last module finishes the parsing by
calling Html.encode() on any remaining plaintext segments. Then, the
framework joins these plaintext strings to create the final HTML
output.

Keep in mind that we want to use meta things also as properties of the
posts. We don't only use them to create the post pages.

We want to be able to do something like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; ls(postdb().collect.has_meta('todo'))
    ...
</span>
or this:

<span class="raw-block">    def todos():
        for post in hkshell.postdb().collect.has_meta('todo'):
            print "%s: %s" % (post.heapid, post.get_meta('todo'))

    &gt;&gt;&gt; todos()
    1: change the subject of this thread
    5: add this to the previous post

We also want these to be automatically processed: IIRC, we agreed that
a meta that starts with '!' should be automatically processed (after a
maintainer's approval).

I don't really understand why. But you don't have to answer it now if
it is just a feeling that we will need that.

What do you mean by "paragraph"? Probably the paragraph's definition
should go into the "what" thread.

</span></span>
This is OK.

You haven't talked about these explicitly:
- The current "body" attribute of the post should remain as it is, the
  list of segments and the HTML representation would be other
  objects (either data attributes (=data members) or local variables
  of some function)
- It seems to me that now we want only one layer between the

  this correct?

Of course. Maybe I dived into implementation a bit early, the

been more elaborated.

Yes. Your examples further emphasize the need for body processing to
be present elsewhere, not just in Generator's context.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; We also want these to be automatically processed: IIRC, we agreed that
&gt; a meta that starts with '!' should be automatically processed (after a
&gt; maintainer's approval).
</span></span>
And of course, the semantics of '!'.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; * the separation of already processed (HTML) and still unprocessed
&gt;&gt; (raw) parts of the body have to be distinguished
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; I don't really understand why. But you don't have to answer it now if
&gt; it is just a feeling that we will need that.
</span></span>
I think I can explain. Suppose we want to decorate all occurences of
authors' names in a special manner, e.g. surround them with @'s, but
only in the original text of the posts, not in the generated output.
Now we'll have to somehow keep track of the already processed or
unprocessed parts of a partly composed body, since we don't process in
one go, but in multiple passes.

Pass 1: add the author's name before each quote.
Pass 2: decorate mentioned names
Pass 3: escape HTML and finish

Before pass 1:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt; I think Attis is right on this.

    Josh, what do you say?
</span>
Before pass 2:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;div id="quoteheader"&gt;Josh wrote:&lt;/div&gt;
    &gt; I think Attis is right on this.

    Josh, what do you say?
</span>
Before pass 3:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;div id="quoteheader"&gt;Josh wrote:&lt;/div&gt;
    &gt; I think @Attis@ is right on this.

    @Josh@, what do you say?
</span>
After pass 3:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;div id="quoteheader"&gt;Josh wrote:&lt;/div&gt;
    &amp;gt; I think @Attis@ is right on this.

    @Josh@, what do you say?
</span>
This is what we want to happen. First, we don't want to decorate the
name inside the div. Secondly, and this is much more important: we
have to HTML-escape the quote introduction, but we mustn't escape the
same character in the HTML part. Therefore, I imagined a partly
processed body as a sequence of blocks, each marked either as being in
HTML or in plaintext.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; What do you mean by "paragraph"? Probably the paragraph's definition
&gt; should go into the "what" thread.
</span></span>
Yes, exactly.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - The current "body" attribute of the post should remain as it is, the
&gt;  list of segments and the HTML representation would be other
&gt;  objects (either data attributes (=data members) or local variables
&gt;  of some function)
</span></span>
This is a very important question. I think it is directly related to a
broader one: when should the processing happen? Also, it brings up the
question: do we have to hardcode the elements parsed from the body?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - It seems to me that now we want only one layer between the
&gt;  string-&gt;paragraphs-as-plain-text and finished-paragraphs-&gt;HTML. It
&gt;  this correct?
</span></span>
Not necessarily -- but it'd be nice.

Why do you use "div id", why not "div class"?

</span></span>
I got your model, but I think it has a flaw.

Let's say we have another "processor" that creates div-blocks from quotes:

<span class="raw-block">     &lt;div class="quoteheader"&gt;Josh wrote:&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class="quote"&gt; I think Attis is right on this.&lt;/div&gt;

     Josh, what do you say?
</span>
How would this interact with the "normal" processing? How would the
@-placer know to process quote and not to process quote header?

Your processed/unprocessed boolean could be replaced with a string
which states the type of that segment. This type could be "quote",
"quoteheader". The processors would know what types of segment they
want to process. This is similar to the model of many tools, I think.
In those tools (e.g. Sphinx, probably GCC), there is a syntax tree
augmented with other information, and the processors can manipulate
the tree. We would have a list instead of a tree, because our
structure is so simple - but otherwise their idea seems more feasible
to me than a pure processed/notprocessed flag.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; - The current "body" attribute of the post should remain as it is, the
&gt;&gt;   list of segments and the HTML representation would be other
&gt;&gt;   objects (either data attributes (=data members) or local variables
&gt;&gt;   of some function)
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; This is a very important question. I think it is directly related to a
&gt; broader one: when should the processing happen? Also, it brings up the
&gt; question: do we have to hardcode the elements parsed from the body?
</span></span>
Do you mean hardcoding the _types_ of the elements? I think there are
two kinds of "types". A type is plain text vs HTML, another is
quote/"quote header"/footnote/etc. I guess if we just say there are these
two kinds of types, the each processor would be free to process only
certain types. (Of course one of these should have a different name;
e.g. plain text/HTML could be "format" and quote/footnote/etc could be
"type".)

BTW, I would like to discuss more examples here before reading the
source code that implements it. You are free to write prototypes, of
course, but it is hard to read source code without knowing what it is
doing. The best way to give that information is to document it; but if
you don't feel like writing documentation yet, examples in this thread
would be as helpful for me.

== Processors and paragraphs ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; - It seems to me that now we want only one layer between the
&gt;&gt;  string-&gt;paragraphs-as-plain-text and finished-paragraphs-&gt;HTML. It
&gt;&gt;  this correct?
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; Not necessarily -- but it'd be nice.
</span></span>
Well, if you want a separate quote-processor, quote-header-creator,
footnote-finder etc. then we will have more than one.

My model in my brain was about how the body parsing will work:

<span class="raw-block">    create paragraphs # paragraphs = list of segments
    for p in paragraphs:
        if p is quote:
            quote_process(p)
        elif p is footnote:
            process_footnote(p)
        elif p is text:
            process_text(p)
        ...
</span>
Your model is probably better though, in the way that it is much
easier to extend:

<span class="raw-block">    create paragraphs # paragraphs = list of segments
    for processor in processors:
        processor(paragraphs)
</span>
However, as this pseudo code snippet shows, probably the most
important thing to get right is the format of the "paragraphs"
list.
