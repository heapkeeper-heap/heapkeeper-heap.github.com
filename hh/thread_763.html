</span></span>Hm. Maybe being an "idea" is an orthogonal dimension to this. Being an
"idea" means that the proposer is not sure about whether the
feature/issue/proposal is useful/implementable.

Maybe issues (=threads with bug/feature/issue/prop tag) should be put
into a different section in the issue tracker and should have
different colors than other issues. Probably they should be marked
with a very different color (I propose cyan :) ) When we decide to
talk about an idea as not just an idea, we could remove the "idea"
tag.

I know this is not the way we have been using the "idea" tag. In an
earlier proposal of mine I wrote about using the "prop" and "idea"
tags [1]. This is the relation between the old and new usages of the
"idea" and "prop" tags:

    old usage | new usage
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    prop      | feature/issue/prop, without an idea tag
    idea      | feature/issue/prop, also having an idea tag

What do you think?

</span></span>OK.

Regarding the choice of colors, you are entirely on your own. I seem
to have a strange agnosia for color aesthetics, which may or may not be
related to my color perception problem.

<div class="body">
<pre class="postbody">Some summarization, to see if I got the idea:

Some HH threads are special, in that we want to track them using a
specialized Hk module, called the issue tracker. These threads fall
into several categories:

- bug (`bug`): threads marked as bugs are about problems with Hk perceived as
  deficiencies, failures to meet an expected standard, and in general,
  discordance between expected and actual function.
- feature (`feature`): threads about the addition of new features to
  Hk
- issue (`issue`): a thread that is about a concrete part of Hk, but
  doesn't fall into any of the
- proposal (`prop`): threads marked as proposals present plans for the
  future, not about concrete parts of Hk, but rather the
  "infrastructure": coding conventions, repository etc.

Any of these may optionally have the "idea" tag, which means that the
author has xer own doubts about the usefulness or feasibility of the
contents of the post.

Is this correct? (I'll add my additions as replies to this post, I just
want to be sure that I've understood what you said.)
