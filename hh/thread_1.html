<pre class="post-body-content">This is the first post to the Heapkeeper heap (or HH for short). This
heap is about the development of the program called Heapkeeper (Hk for
short).

I also suggest that we should really try to keep this heap tidy from
the beginning. Now we have the tools for that, and we have a fresh new
start: we have no reason to procrastinate.
