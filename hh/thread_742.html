<pre class="post-body-content">My hkrc is seriously lagging behind, so I'm tidying it up. I'll use
yours as a basis for this, which means that I'll also find things in
your hkrc.

== Editing ==

Are the `vim()`, `gvim()` and `edit_file()` functions obsolete? I
think they should be, now that the EDITOR variable is handled
correctly.

Also, what do you use `get_content()` for?

== Generating indices ==

It seems like you generate the indices twice (three times, actually,
but the third is for the generator). You have this:

def gen_indices(postdb):

<span class="raw-block">    hkcustomlib.gen_indices(postdb)
    # Date options
    date_options = hkcustomlib.date_defopts()
    ...
    genopts.shorttags = True
    genopts.date_fun = date_fun

    # Generating my index
    hklib.Generator(postdb).gen_indices(genopts)

    # Generator the issue tracker index
    generator = issue_tracker.create_generator(genopts)
    generator.gen_indices(genopts)
</span>
So, first you do the default index generation, then the customized
one. Is this necessary?

There is a typo: "Generator the issue tracker index" should read
"Generating the ..."

== Collecting posts matching any of a set of tags ==

In `index0()`, where you collect posts based on tags, you wrote this:

<span class="raw-block">    python_tags = ['python', 'Python']
    ps_python = ps_all.collect(has_tag(python_tags))
</span>
which uses:

def has_tag(tags):
    def has_tag_fun(post):
        for tag in tags:
            if post.has_tag(tag):
                return True
        return False
    return has_tag_fun

In my hkrc, this reads:

<span class="raw-block">    ps_py = ps_all.collect.has_tag_from(('python', 'Python'))
</span>
You introduced your solution on 2009-03-21, I did mine on 2009-05-09.
We did basically the same thing (albeit yours has a brilliant
functional style ;)).

What do you think about this new implementation of `Post.has_tag`?

<span class="raw-block">    def has_tag(self, tagset):
        assert(isinstance(tagset, str) or hasattr(tagset, '__iter__'))
        if isinstance(tagset, str):
            return tagset in self._header['Tag']
        for tag in tagset:
            if tag in self._header['Tag']:
                return True
        return False
</span>
Then we could have

<span class="raw-block">    ps_python = ps_all.collect.has_tag(['python', 'Python'])
</span>
which is cleaner and more simple than our previous solutions.

== Dead code ==

Your `sections1()` seems to be dead code. (Also, why 1204?)

== Improvements ==

I reordered the functions, added docstrings and removed old code.

== Observation ==

The crusade to tidy up my hkrc resulted in criticizing yours...

<pre class="post-body-content">Well, my hkrc needs tidying, as well... I will tidy it up when I will

Yes.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Also, what do you use `get_content()` for?
</span></span>
For the same thing hkcustomlib.edit_files uses the `old_content`
variable. If a file did not change (its old content is the same as its
new content), it is unnecessary to call its `touch` method.

&gt; So, first you do the default index generation, then the customized

</span></span>
What do you mean by "necessary"? It is necessary in the sense that
all the different index generators generate different index pages.

1. hkcustomlib.gen_indices(postdb) generates the default main index
   page that contains all posts.
2. hklib.Generator(postdb).gen_indices(genopts) generates my own index
   pages, 'ums' and 'hh' that are defined in my hkrc module.
3. The issue tracker generator generates the "all issues" and "sorted
   issues" index pages that are defined in issue_tracker.py.

Thanks.

I guess I wanted my solution to be a short term solution. The long
term solution would be to automatically convert tags to match the
canonical form (e.g. "Python" -&gt; "python"). Maybe we should not use
uppercase letters at all in tags.

</span></span>
Nice! Go ahead.

Note: Later I want to make self._header['Tag'] a set instead of a list
for efficiency reasons. But that can wait. I'll file an issue about
it.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; == Dead code ==
&gt;
&gt; Your `sections1()` seems to be dead code. (Also, why 1204?)
</span></span>
I think I made `sections1` for a very specific purpose; probably
something was wrong with the thread of 1204 and I wanted to see only
that thread when doing the debugging. And I didn't remove it, because
I thought when I have a trouble with a specific thread again, it will
be useful to just change 1204 to something else.

== Improvements ==

I'll rewrite mine after I pushed the new generator.

OK, it has been implemented and pushed (it used to be in a topic
branch, but now it is integrated in the main branch.

However, I think not all remaining code has been updated to use this.
It should be fairly easy to do this: just find and disable all
remaining `has_tag` functions (I think there are 2 of them.), and fix
whatever is broken by this.
