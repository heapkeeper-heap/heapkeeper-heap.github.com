<pre class="postbody">I wrote a page about the state of the project and inserted an item
into the index page called "The state of the project". You are welcome
to comment on it. It is also uploaded to the project homepage.

Index page modification:

* **The state of the project**: Heapkeeper is in a usable form now, although
  there are many things which could be done to make it more convenient. Read
  more on the project's :doc:`State &lt;state&gt;` page. Heapkeeper is under active
  development; look at the `commit history`__ or the `impact graph`__ of the
  repository.

__ <a href="http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/commits/master">http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/commits/master</a>
__ <a href="http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/graphs/impact">http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/graphs/impact</a>

The new page:

The state of the project
------------------------

.. include:: defs.hrst

This page describes the status of the project's components.

- Source code: Heapkeeper is in a usable form now, although there are many
  things which could be done to make it more convenient. The source code is
  constantly in a good shape, all commits in the repository since May should
  work fine.
- Tests: we aim for 100% code coverage. We don't have that now, but we have
  3100 lines of test code for 6500 lines of normal code. All test pass in all
  commits since May.
- Documentation: There are three important parts of Heapkeeper's documentation:
  the user documentation, the module documentation and the developer
  documentation. The user documentation consists of a single :doc:`tutorial`
  right now, with which we are satisfied and which is up-to-date. We plan to
  write a page about the customization of Heapkeeper, and also a cookbook. The
  module documentation mainly consists of the docstrings of classes and
  functions, which is written into the source code. This is complete and
  up-to-date for |hkutils|, |hkshell| and |hkcustomlib|, but it is not ready
  for |hklib|, which is the largest module of all. The developer documentation,
  which describes the ideas and main concepts of Heapkeeper at a higher level,
  is also quite incomplete.
- Homepage: The non-documentation part of the homepage is fine for now. We
  could improve the web page design by making a custom theme though.
- Processes: We are just on the way to develop our workflow and other
  processes. We have ideas and we are trying them out in practice, but we will
  have to see.

</span></span>What do you think about this:

"Workflow: our workflow has gone stable with the release of 0.3. We
strongly rely on Git in continuous integration of bugfixes and new
features into mature code."

We could also mention it here that the underscore-branches may be
rewritten, but I think in this short status summary, it would be too
much detail (and it would not do too much to prove how mature our
methods are, at least to someone not acquainted to Git workflows).

"Procedures" would be a better word for what you want to express, but
I replaced it with "workflow" since I don't know what other procedures
you meant.

</span></span>Workflow is all right. I meant things like how to use the repository,
how to make a new release, how to add a new feature (e.g. in the best
case the commit contains tests, docstrings and the modifications of
the rst files), or how to update the website.
