The post references in the body should be processed and shown in the
post page. Example:

Post body:

<span class="raw-block">    I like that robot, even though
    it is so silly... [1]

    [1] ums/123
</span>
Simplified version of post body in post page:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;div class="body"&gt;
    I like that robot, even though&lt;br/&gt;
    it is so silly... [1]&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;span class="footnote"&gt;
    [1] &lt;a href="thread_123#post_123"&gt;ums/123&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</span>
To make it efficient, I propose the Post class to have a lazy data
attribute called _body_segments that would contain body/footnote
segments. It would be the first step towards the body parsing. (We
talked a lot about the idea of segments and I think we agreed on using
it.)

== Multiline posts ==

The feature would handle multi-line posts:

<span class="raw-block">    [1] This is
        a footnote
</span>
I don't know when exactly should we accept the next line as part of
the footnote.

Alternatives:

- when it is perfectly indented:

<span class="raw-block">    [1] This is
        a footnote
</span>
- when its indentation level is equal to or greater than that of the
  perfect indentation:

<span class="raw-block">    [1] This is
          still a footnote
</span>
- when it starts with a whitespace:

<span class="raw-block">    [1] This is
     also a footnote
</span>
Also, should a footnote be terminated by an empty line?

I propose the following, but I have no strong opinion:

<span class="raw-block">    If the previous line is a footnote, than the current line is its
    continuation if and only if:

    1. the current line starts with a whitespace, and
    2. the current line contains other characters then whitespace
</span>
I'm curious about your opinion, but I don't want to have a long
discussion about this. Such footnotes are rare, and we can change our
minds if we see a reason for that in the future.

== "new post syntax" tag ==

I used the tag "new post syntax" to avoid the confusion with the
long-long discussions we had. I think we now should follow a pragmatic
approach and implement one small step at a time. Later we can still
have a more general system if we feel that Hk has matured enough to
handle complicated post syntax.

This was implemented in commit a755a20 [1].

The implementation is more general than the proposal in the root of
this thread, because post references are parsed everywhere in the body
(except for raw blocks), not only in footnotes.
