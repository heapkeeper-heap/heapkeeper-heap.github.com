<pre class="post-body-content">Splitting posts in hkweb is the feature that would save the most time
in hkweb, but it seems to be a somewhat demanding task to implement.

Splitting posts means adding a new post, then editing the old and new
post at the same time, then saving both. Of these steps, only the
first one is missing at the moment.

The "add post" feature is now implemented as a button, labeled
"add child". Clicking this button adds a new child to the post in
question, which would start in editing mode at once. Clicking "save" on
this box would result in the creation of a post, while clicking
"cancel" dismisses the box while leave the post database intact.

With this working (6c7cc72, hkweb{,.js}: adding new posts
implemented), we can do all our post splitting in hkweb, but there is
at least one disadvantage: the created new box might be very far from
the post to split!

Suppose this is our thread structure:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Root post
        &lt;2&gt; Main topic; side topic
            &lt;3&gt; Main topic continued
                &lt;4&gt; Main topic continued
                    &lt;5&gt; Main topic continued
                        &lt;6&gt; Main topic continued
</span>
We want to split the side topic in "2" into a new subthread. So, we
want to add a new child to "1" (that is, a sibling to "2"). If this
gets added as the "newest child" to "1", then post "3", "4" and "5"
will separate "2" and its new siblings, which is bad, since we want to
transfer text between them. A possible solution: posts "3", "4" and
"5" can be folded to minimize the separation, and this could even be
done automatically. I think this is a valid way to handle splitting,
and it is definitely the easiest to implement, though probably not the
most elegant one. (Note: such automatic folding is not yet
implemented.)

The Holy Grail solution to this would be representing the splitting of
the post as a vertical split on the screen. What makes this approach
ultimately different is that it requires a page layout that is not
yet supported: (at least) two posts displayed side-by side. An
impression of how this look like while the split is being made (with
only the relevant part displayed in detail):

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Root post
        &lt;2&gt; Main topic             | &lt;7&gt; Side topic
          |Save| |Cancel|          |   |Save| |Cancel|
        +------------------------+ | +----------------------+
        | Main topic being       | | | Side topic has been  |
        | edited here...         | | | copied here...       |
        +------------------------+ | +----------------------+
            &lt;3&gt; Main topic continued
                &lt;4&gt; Main topic continued
                    &lt;5&gt; Main topic continued
                        &lt;6&gt; Main topic continued
</span>
The implementation involves creating a table with only one row and two
columns, and putting the old post's box into the left cell, and the
right one's box into the right cell.

From then on, we edit these two posts just as we normally would. This
means that no new code is needed on the server side, only in the
client.

This is halfway implemented in the current `_hkweb-add` branch
(bfedcf6, hkweb: splitting posts added). However, widths of the cells
are not right (only if your screen is 1280 pixels wide), and the
"Cancel" button does not work as it should (removes the post, but
does not clean up the table).

When we split a post, the new post file needs a file name. `enew()`
has a mechanism that can find the next numbered filename with a given
prefix. The current implementation always uses the prefix `hkweb_`;
this should be customizable.
