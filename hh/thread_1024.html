Since post 3820, posts are not parsed correctly.

The post body contains things like this:

<span class="raw-block">    --0016e68fcdeaa61245047c7c631a
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
</span>
Also, the non-ascii characters in the text are encoded:

<span class="raw-block">    Szerintem zavarn=E1, de ilyen cs=FAnyas=E1gra m=E9g nem l=E1ttam p=E9ld=E1t=

We should write test cases for the email parser part of
EmailDownloader, because we never know when will GMail change
something again, and this is not an easy area. The programmer has to
know the email format standard (RFC2822), the MIME standard (a bunch
of RFCs), and the IMAP standard (RFC 3501) to understand other parts
of EmailDownloader.

Great!

I think the list of understood encodings is incomplete. I did a small
research. Sylpheed keeps downloaded messages in a format equivalent to
the original MIME format in one file per message. So it was as easy as
`grep | sort | uniq` to compile this list of encodings I've
encountered so far:

<span class="raw-block">    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8Bit
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: Quoted-Printable
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: x-uuencode
    Content-Transfer-Encoding:quoted-printable
</span>
The current implementation handles for `base64` and
`quoted-printable`, and it recognizes these in both upper- and
lowercase. So these remain:

<span class="raw-block">    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: x-uuencode
</span>
`7bit` is the default. Despite this, sometimes it is specified. Such
cases would now yield a warning, but the emails are correctly parsed.

I think `8bit` and `binary` don't have to be decoded either, but they
shouldn't give a warning.

The last one, `x-uuencode` is a strange one, it can be found in only
one out of the 5532 messages examined. It is used for the encoding of
an attachment, so it is probably safe to ignore it.

These are not handled now. Why do you think they should not give a
warning? If something has 8bit encoding, is it latin1? Shouldn't we
convert that into UTF-8?

<pre class="post-body-content">This is how I understand this topic. It is not necessarily the correct
answer.

I think in the world of MIME/SMTP email, content-encoding and charset
are two different things.

For example, this is from an email I wrote in Hungarian:

<span class="raw-block">    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
</span>
This is from an email I wrote in English:

<span class="raw-block">    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
</span>
(`Content-Transfer-Encoding` is omitted, so it is `7bit`.)

Charset and encoding refer to two different layers of the stack. Let's
see what this means if we want to send this Hungarian sentence:

<span class="raw-block">    Szép időnk van.
</span>
Note: there are two characters in this sentence that are not in the
lower 128 chars of ISO-8859-1 (that is, which are not in standard
ASCII). The first (the accented e) is a fairly common character, e.g.
French also has this, and therefore, it is part of the higher 128
characters of ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. Latin-1). (Latin-1 is a charset which
covers the most widely spoken European languages [1].) The second, the
o with a double comma accent is a character specific to Hungarian. It
is therefore not part of ISO-8859-1, but part of ISO-8859-2. Of
course, all these characters are part of Unicode Plane 0 (the
so-called Base Multilingual Plane [2]).

From this it follows that this sentence can be correctly represented
either in Unicode or in Latin-2. Unicode is expressed in a family of
different "encodings", which would be a confusing word to use, since
this concept is called a "charset" in MIME. So, Unicode is expressed
in several different charsets, of which three are widely used: UTF-16,
UTF-8 and UTF-7. Of these, UTF-8 is by far the most common. UTF-7 is a
strange beast, and no email in my corpus of 5.5k messages uses it.
UTF-16 is used by Microsoft Notepad, for example, when asked for;
Microsoft also uses it in PE (EXE, DLL etc.) files, and some others.

If we represent our sentence in UTF-8 and Latin-2, this is how it
would look like in a hexdump:

<span class="raw-block">    53 7a c3 a9 70 20 69 64 c5 91 6e 6b 20 76 61 6e 2e  |Sz..p id..nk van.|
</span>
If we represent it in Latin-2, here's how it looks like:

<span class="raw-block">    53 7a e9 70 20 69 64 f5 6e 6b 20 76 61 6e 2e  |Sz.p id.nk van.|
</span>
And this is the "content" that we'll encode in the next step using a
method represented by a possible value of `Content-Transfer-Encoding`.

`7bit` is the default encoding. It is quite restrictive, mainly for
historical reasons, but it's guaranteed to work anywhere. However, it
is impossible to transmit content where not all octets are smaller
than 128, i.e. where bit 7 is not 0. In hex, this translates to the
first digit being less than 8. It is easy to see that our content
can't be transmitted using the `7bit` encoding. [3]

`8bit` is quite simple, since it seems to do nothing. It represents a
sequence of octets as -- the same sequence of octets. But there's a catch:
not every sequence can be encoded in `8bit`. The limitations are not
as harsh as with `7bit`: now all octets may be present, but lines may
not be longer than 993 characters. That means that there can't be more
than 993 octets between two neighboring "0x0D 0x0A" octet pairs (that
is "CR LF", of course, or "\r\n" for C-ists). Of course you can't just
ask a PNG file to respect that, but, purely by chance, many binary
files may be sent using `8bit`.

`binary` is total freedom: any octet sequence is represented as
itself, just like with `8bit`, and every octet sequence may be
encoded.

It is easy to remember that in some cases the charset, while in other
cases, the encoding said "no" to certain characters. This means that
not every combination will handle every content. Let's see some
examples.



<span class="raw-block">    Content | Charset | Encoding | Result

    fridge  | latin1  | 7bit     | OK
    fridge  | latin1  | 8bit     | OK

    冰箱    | utf-8   | 8bit     | OK
    冰箱    | utf-8   | base64   | OK
</span>
The conclusion of this table is that the farther a writing system is
from English, the fewer charset/encoding combinations will work.

Now I'll try to answer your questions:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Why do you think they should not give a
&gt; warning?
</span></span>
They should not give warnings because they are perfectly legal. See
e.g. the original of <a href="../hh/thread_172.html#post-summary-hh-173">heap://173</a> or heap://1984.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; If something has 8bit encoding, is it latin1?
</span></span>
If the encoding is 8bit, the charset may be anything. We have to
respect the charset declatation of the `Content-Type` header, if it's
present; but I don't know what it defaults to when it isn't.

To see how `8bit` can be used to "encode" both Latin-2 and UTF-8,
compare the originals of the previously mentioned <a href="../hh/thread_172.html#post-summary-hh-173">heap://173</a> and
heap://1984.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Shouldn't we convert that into UTF-8?
</span></span>
It would be reasonable to convert text in any other charset to
UTF-8: the heap posts have no way of specifying charset, and frankly,
I am happy it doesn't. UTF-8 is optimal for our purposes.


[1] With some bias, of course.
[2] This roughly means the first 64k code points of Unicode.  Unicode is
32-bit. Needless to say, this is a huge space of code points ("code point"
is Unicodish for "character"), and it is unlikely that all human writing
systems that ever existed together would have this many characters. The
"inhabited" part of Unicode is larger than Plane 0, but I think it
was the aim of the creators that glyphs of all (major?) living scripts
should fit into this first plane.  Examples of writing systems that were
banished to Plane 1 are Hungarian runic script and Tengwar.
[3] I silently dismissed UTF-7 with the reason that it is too awkward.
It indeed is, to the point that the Internet Mail Consortium warns
against using it (according to Wikipedia). Still, if we used UTF-7 to
represent the Hungarian sentence, it could be transmitted in the
`7bit` encoding.
[4] This is almost incidental: UTF-8 generally isn't 7-bit safe. But
it has been constructed so that all ASCII characters are coded to
themselves, so encoding ordinary English text is an identity
operation.
