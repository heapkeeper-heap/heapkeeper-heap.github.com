something very similar. Maybe it is at home is my Draft folder? Hm.

We should delete those branches instantly. It is difficult to
comprehend the contents of the repository when there at many branches.

<pre class="post-body-content">What is your opinion, if you have a look at the heap? I have _e,
_review and _custom-post-summary branches. Do they help you? For me,
it would be easier if I just removed the first two.

I don't have these branches! I removed them quite a while ago.

<span class="raw-block">    $ git fetch origin
    $ git fetch attis
    $ git branch -a
      _count
      _custom-post-summary
      _dl-improved
      _e
    * _issue-tracker
      _review
      exp
      exp-old
      master
      attis/_count
      attis/_dl-improved
      attis/_e
      attis/_fastdownload
      attis/_golem
      attis/_review
      attis/fastdownload
      attis/master
      origin/HEAD
      origin/_count
      origin/_custom-post-summary
      origin/_dl-improved
      origin/_e
      origin/_issue-tracker
      origin/_review
      origin/master
</span>
But you could remove your unnecessary remote branches: you seem to
have two fastdownload branches for example.
