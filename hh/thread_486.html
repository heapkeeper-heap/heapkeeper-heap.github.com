I uploaded the tidy repo to a sandbox:

<span class="raw-block">    http://github.com/hcs42/sandbox
</span>
Do you think everything is OK?

== Tag ==

I saw that tag v0.1 has the comment "Heapmanipulator v0.1 released.". I guess
it would be wrong to say "Heapkeeper v0.1 released"...

That's why I said Heapmanipulator. I wrote about it in the thread
"Heapkeeper version 0.3":

" I accept these, but I think the project's history should preserve the
" project's name as it was at the time. Both v0.1 and v0.2 were releases
" of Heapmanipulator, which became Heapkeeper only between v0.2 and
" v0.3.

I think so. I did a download-generate test, it seems OK. Also passes
the test suite. Other than that, the names are OK, the tags are OK, so
I think we can use this repo.
