I hope I can dig deeper into it in the weekend. I will fix the test
cases if you say so.

== elif ==

A small comment though: there is an "elif" statement in Python. So
please do not write

    if a:
        b
    else:
        if c:
            d
        else:
            e

but write

    if a:
        b
    elif c:
        d
    else:
        e

instead.

== Same commits ==

What happened to 179f5cf18e and 4e32bdad1c, why do they both seem the
same? Have you used "git amend" after push, or was it something else?
It is not a problem, I'm just curious :)

</span></span>Although git credits me with writing the code in question, I think it's a
mistake. I merely renamed that function, and git thinks it's all new.

I did a git blame in the master thread:
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1993)  if isinstance(item, str):
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1994)      strings.append(item)
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1995)
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1996)  else:
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1997)      if item != None:
    cfac9c01 heapmanip.py (Csaba Hoch  1998)          post = item

(I removed the date column; timestamp was "2009-02-18 23:43:07 +0100" for all
lines.

</span></span>I'm sorry that I have not referred to the code in question, I'll do it
now. But first I'll explain why the code you found is that way it is.

== The code not in question ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Although git credits me with writing the code in question, I think it's a
&gt; mistake. I merely renamed that function, and git thinks it's all new.

</span></span>If you talk about the thread and summarize_thread functions, I think
you _copied_ and not _renamed_ it. But you are right -- I wrote those
else and if. But there is a reason for that; the mentioned code looks
like this:

    if a:
        b
    else:
        if c:
            d
        else:
            e
        x # note this command

So it cannot be replaced by elifs easily.

== The code in question ==

This is the commit in question (179f5cf18e):

    @@ -2092,10 +2120,13 @@ class Generator(object):
             date_str = options.date_fun(post, options)

             section = options.section
    -        if section.posts == CYCLES:
    +        if options.always_active:
                 active = True
             else:
    -            active = post in section.posts
    +            if section.posts == CYCLES:
    +                active = True
    +            else:
    +                active = post in section.posts

             if options.locallinks:
                 link = '#' + post.heapid()

That is the new version of the code that could be simplified with
elif (in Generator.post_summary):

    section = options.section
    if options.always_active:
        active = True
    else:
        if section.posts == CYCLES:
            active = True
        else:
            active = post in section.posts

Or now that I have a look at it more closely, a simple if-else is
enough.
