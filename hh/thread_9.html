<pre class="post-body-content">Not at all.

== "OK" responses ==

An "OK" post means that you, as a HH user (and probably Heapkeeper
developer) agree with a proposal (or at least you don't have any
objections that are worth mentioning). The proposal usually has its
own thread. The "OK" convention is related only to HH, not other
heaps.

== [r] ==

If you are a heap maintainer, you would add [r] to a post when you
think that it is OK. (E.g. it does not contain meta-commands to be
executed). It would help the maintenance of a heap, because this way
a maintainer's work could described as this:
1. Download the new posts.
2. Read through the posts without [r] tag. (Mostly they will be new
   posts I guess, but not necessarily.) If they need some change,
   change them.
3. Add [r] tag to the posts that are OK. (If you had time to finish
   with all posts (without [r]), then you should add [r] for all of
   them.)
4. The work is finished for today. You don't need to care about posts
   with [r], as they have been already reviewed by either you or
   another maintainer in the past.

The [r] tag would go individually to the posts. This convention makes
sense for all heaps.

<pre class="post-body-content">It doesn't say it is sure that it does not need any further editing;
it says that the maintainer currently doesn't see anything that should
be done. It is like committing your code or pushing it to GitHub: you
don't say it doesn't have to be rewritten ever, but the fact that you
committed it means that you think it reached a certain quality.

However, you could do a git-blame on the "Tag: r" line.

care about when the post was reviewed. I only care about the fact that
it was reviewed once, it does not contain todo-s, and it does not

maintainers much easier.

We could add a date for the revision, but I don't see any point in
that. If you think there is a use for that, I'm eager to read about
it.
