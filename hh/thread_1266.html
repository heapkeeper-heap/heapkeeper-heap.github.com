<pre class="post-body-content">I'm happy to announce that Heapkeeper v0.6 has been released.

The main improvement of this release is introducing Heapkeeper's web
interface.

Major new features:

- Heapkeeper has a web interface called hkweb that displays posts and
  allows editing them. Editing can be done either on the post bodies
  or on the raw post text that includes the header attributes. hkweb
  supports folding (hiding and showing the body of individual posts).
- The enew() hkshell command adds dates to the created post
  automatically.
- Raw blocks are recognized within post bodies and are shown in gray
  in the HTML pages.
- Links are parsed within meta text.
- The title of the HTML thread page is now the subject of the root of
  the thread.
- Links to children are displayed in the HTML pages.
- The generated HTML pages are valid XHTML pages.

Major bugfixes:

- Non-breakable space is converted to normal space in downloaded
  emails.
- Leading whitespace is preserved in post bodies.
