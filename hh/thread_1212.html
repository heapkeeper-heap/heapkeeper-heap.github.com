<pre class="post-body-content">Normally, emails have a "From:" header field. However, some people use
clients that are apparently buggy, and mailing lists are not free from
such messages. See for example this:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2004-October/000343.html

Parsing such messages currently fails. Even worse, the resulting
exception is not caught anywhere, so it flies all the way up to
hkshell, causing any `dl()` operation to stop at the affected post.

I think two things should work differently:
- we should catch any exceptions that are generated while parsing
individual messages,
- we should handle posts without authors.

The question is how do you think authorless posts should be handled?
We have several options:
- have `Post.author()` return None -- would probably break a lot of
things (and I think this is what happens now),
- have `Post.author()` return an empty string -- would not break that
many things, but
- have `Post.author()` return something like 'none' or 'no author' --
I think it would be the responsibility of the generator to print
something like this for such messages.

(Curiously, for the example above, the ubuntu-devel mailing list's
mbox archive contains an introduction line that contains the author,
but there is no matching header item.)

I would prefer Post.author() to return an empty string. Other similar
methods (Post.subject(), Post.parent(), Post.date(), Post.date_str())
return an empty string when there is no real value in the post.
(Although Post.messid() returns None.)
