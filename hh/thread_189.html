<pre class="postbody">I have looked through the first commit of the four. Here are my
comments.

== User experience ==

I tried out the (last version) of the new thread-thing, and I have to
say, it was a great user experience!

== Cheating with spaces ==

hklib.Html.post_summary_table:

     '&lt;tr class="%s"&gt;' % (class_,) + \
  -  Html.post_summary(link, author, subject, tags, index, date, 'td')+\
  +  Html.post_summary(link, author, subject, tags, index, date, 'td') + \
     '&lt;/tr&gt;\n'

There was a reason for writing ")+\" instead of ") + \": the latter
line does not fit in 79 characters. That's why I cheated.

== More compact code ==

hklib.Html.thread_post_header:

  +  def thread_post_header(link, author, subject, tags, index, date):
  +      """Creates a summary for a post as a div, and closes it
  +      immediately."""
  +      class_ = 'postsummary'
  +      return \
  +          '&lt;div class="postbox" id="%s"&gt;\n' % (index, ) + \
  +          Html.enclose(
  +              class_,
  +              Html.post_summary(
  +                  link, author, subject, tags, index, date, 'span')) + \
  +          '&lt;/div&gt;\n'

You can make a bit more compact code (I'm patching your patch):

     def thread_post_header(link, author, subject, tags, index, date):
         """Creates a summary for a post as a div, and closes it
         immediately."""
  -      class_ = 'postsummary'
         return \
             '&lt;div class="postbox" id="%s"&gt;\n' % (index, ) + \
             Html.enclose(
  -              class_,
  +              'postsummary',
                 Html.post_summary(
                     link, author, subject, tags, index, date, 'span')) + \
             '&lt;/div&gt;\n'

== Documentation ==

hklib.GeneratorOptions.__init__:

     def __init__(self,
                  indices=hkutils.NOT_SET,
                  write_toc=False,
                  shortsubject=False,
                  shorttags=False,
  +               locallinks=False,

Would you document the attributes like this before merging the
"threads" branch with the master? You know best what these are -- you
have to explain me anyway, and why not do it in the docstings.

== Blank lines and related methods ==

hklib.Generator.summarize_thread:

         return ''.join(l)
  +
  +
  +  def summarize_thread(self, post, options):

PEP 8 says about blank lines:

  Blank Lines

    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related
    functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related
    one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

I'm not sure we should put two blank lines here (and before
full_thread), just because they are long functions.

What I don't follow in the PEP 8: I use the same blank-line system for
methods and top-level functions, i.e. I don't put two blank lines
between related top-level functions.

I sometimes also use this when I want to group functions:

    class C:

        # group 1

        def f(self):
            pass

        def f2(self):
            pass

        # group 2

        def f(self):
            pass

Maybe I should put an additional blank line before the comments?

== Duplicated code ==

Generator.summarize_thread is almost the same as Generator.thread,
andGenerator.full_thread is almost the same as Generator.post.

We should not have duplicated code like these. I will think about how
to refactor this code, you don't have to. Probably the refactoring
would reveal us a more generic behaviour behind these functions, so in
the end hklib would be not just nicer and smaller, but more powerful
than before.

== Docstring ==

hklib.Generator.full_thread:

  +  def full_thread(self, thread, options):
  +      """Converts the whole thread into HTML.
  +
  +      **Arguments:**
  +
  +      - *thread* (:class:`Post`)
  +      - *options* (:class:`GeneratorOptions`)
  +
  +      **Returns:** ``HtmlStr``
  +
  +      **Notes:**
  +      Don't forget that a thread is identified by its root post.
  +      """

I think the information in the note has its place after explaining
what the *thread* argument is for:

     def full_thread(self, thread, options):
         """Converts the whole thread into HTML.

         **Arguments:**

  -      - *thread* (:class:`Post`)
  +      - *thread* (:class:`Post`) -- The thread to be converted,
  +        represented by its root post.
         - *options* (:class:`GeneratorOptions`)

         **Returns:** ``HtmlStr``
  -
  -      **Notes:**
  -      Don't forget that a thread is identified by its root post.
         """

You weren't consistent, though:

hklib.Generator.summarize_thread:

  +  def summarize_thread(self, post, options):
  [...]
  +
  +      **Arguments:**
  +
  +      - *post* (``None |`` :class:`Post`) -- The root of the thread to be
  +        printed.
  +      - *options* (:class:`GeneratorOptions`)
  +
  +      **Returns:** ``HtmlStr``
  +      """

Probably it is a good idea to have a pseudo-type called Thread.
Pseudo-types are not real Python types, but we use them as types in
the documentation so we can talk about them easily. To see how
pseudo-types are defined and used, have a look at for example the
pseudo-type called PrePost in the documentation [1].

I think we can leave it now as it is, most of the docstrings of hklib
are not correct rst texts anyway. We will go through all hklib at some
point, and will update the format of all docstings. It would be nice
to keep the docstrings up-to-date, though.

== Using PostDB.threads ==

hklib.Generator.gen_threads:

  +  for thread in self._postdb.threads():

Maybe _postdb.roots() would be a bit better than _postdb.threads().
The difference is that _postdb.roots() is the set of roots, while
_postdb.threads is a dictionary between the roots and their
descendants. roots() is faster to compute of course; threads() is
actually implemented by calling roots() and then computing further
things. Since roots() is exactly what you want here, it would be nicer
to use that. (Even though the "threads" name seems to fit more in this
context.)

== Fair enough ==

hklib.Generator.section:

     if not (thread &amp; posts).is_set([]):
  +      # if section contains at least part of the thread
         l.append(self.thread(root, options))

Do you think I should write more comments like this?

== Footprint of "print" statement? ==

hklib.Generator.gen_indices:

     for i, section in enumerate(index.sections):
         options.section = section
  -      f.write(self.section(i, options))
  +      sect = self.section(i, options)
  +      f.write(sect)
         del options.section
     f.write(Html.doc_footer())

I have only one question: why? :)

== Newlines at the end of file ==

hklib.Generator.gen_threads:

  +  log('Thread HTMLs generated.')
  +
  +

What do you say to not leaving any whitespace at the end of a file?
(Except for the last newline character that is not shown by Vim
explicitly.)

</span></span>I have not looked at the other commits yet. But if all the tests work,
it is OK to merge.

It is nice solution in my opinion to merge "master" _into_ "threads"
until we say "threads" is OK. (I saw that is what you had done.) If
you say though that "threads" is OK, and it would be more convenient
for you to use Hk after merging it into "master", you are free to do
it.
