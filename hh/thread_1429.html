<pre class="post-body-content">== Post id types ==

In the server side (Python), the identifiers of posts are either
represented as tuples (e.g. `('hh', '1')`) or strings (e.g. `'hh/1'`).
When they are tuples, their pseudo type is called PostId; when they
are strings, it is called PostIdStr.

In the client side (JavaScript), the identifiers of posts are always
represented as strings. Unfortunately, we have to have two
representations here as well, because we cannot use the '/' character
is HTML ids. So in the client, one representation uses the '-'
character as a separator between the heap id and the post index (e.g.
`'hh-1'`). This pseudo type is called PostId, but it is different from
the server side PostId. I chose this name because this is the natural type
to use in JavaScript when identifying posts. The other representation
is called PostIdStr, and it is same as in the server side.

Since only the PostIdStr is used in both parties, it shall be used in
the client-server communication.

== Conversion ==

There are functions for each desired conversion.

In the server side (Python), the conversion is usually done through a
post object. Usually we have to get the post object anyway. The
conversion can be done in the following way:

- postdb.post(('hh', '1')).post_id_str() -&gt; 'hh/1'
- postdb.post('hh/1').post_id() -&gt; ('hh', '1')

This works only if the post exists, but we usually don't want to
convert post ids that does not exist in the post database to different
format.

In the client side (JavaScript), there are two functions in hkweb.js
to be used:

- postIdToPostIdStr('hh-1') -&gt; 'hh/1'
- postIdStrToPostId('hh/1') -&gt; 'hh-1'

== Notes ==

1. This unfortunately does not mean that no Python code has to use the
   'hh-1' format, because the server generates client side code, i.e.
   the Python code generates HTML and sometimes JavaScript. BTW,
   writing JavaScript code (e.g. event handling) in *.js files is
   preferred over generating it by Python code. We can start a new
   thread about this, if it is not obvious...

2. I pointed out this design detail because Attis converted the post
   id in the server (in hkweb.py) to the 'hh-1' format [1]. It is
   better to send 'hh/1' and let JavaScript call the postIdStrToPostId
   function. I fixed this (but haven't pushed it).
