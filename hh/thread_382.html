&gt; The header is post files is terminated by a blank line. Previously this line
&gt; had to be totally empty. Now it is allowed to put white spaces into the blank
&gt; line and it will still terminate the header.

Isn't this a bit in conflict with your earlier aim [1] to make the
syntax of post files as rigid as possible?

Yes, it is. And there are other strong reasons against it. On the other hand,
there are strong reasons that support it. First I will tell my own story, then I
will enumerate the pros and cons.

== My story ==

When writing a tutorial, I had blocks like this in the rst:

<span class="raw-block">    .. code-block:: none

        Author: ashe@usrobots.com
        Subject: RB-34
        Tag: interesting
        Tag: robot

        RB-34 is behaving wierdly. You should have a look at it.
        I have never seen anything like that. It seems as if it
        could read my mind.

        Ashe
</span>
At this point in the tutorial, I ask the reader to create a post and copy and
paste this text into the editor. I tried it out, and parsing of the newly
created post failed. The reason was that instead of copying it from the browser,
I copied it from Vim. I used block selection (ctrl-v) of course, since I wanted
to get rid of the four spaces in the beginning of every line.

Try it out for example on this email. Open a Vim and go to the character "A" of
"Author: ashe@usrobots.com". Hit ctrl-v in normal mode, starting a block
selection. Type 9j to jump to the "A" of "Ashe". Hit &lt;end&gt; or $ to select all
text in the 10 lines from the 4th column. Then paste the text to the end of the
file with p or P. The lines that should be empty contain a bunch of spaces!

If people read the rst documents instead of the HTML ones, even if they don't
use block selection, they can still miss deleting the spaces from the empty
lines.

I did this twice, and then I decided that if I have a hard time with it, anyone
else experiencing it would just give up the Tutorial and Heapkeeper. They don't
want to use a program that cannot parse a file written in its own tutorial.

You could say that people will probably use the browser to copy the text from
and not a text editor. But in my opinion, if the parser breaks when having a
non-empty line, this definitely will be problem for other people. And sometimes
won't even break but misunderstand the post file:

<span class="raw-block">    Author: somebody
    Subject: something
    &lt;space&gt;
    Parent: mother

    Children: none

    This is the whole form. Please send it to my boss.
</span>
I admit that it is unlikely that someone writes a post like this, but in the
future we may have more attributes. We may even say at one point that we accept
any attribute so that Heapkeeper is forward compatible. But this is a point of
another discussion.

== Pros ==

In general, the pros are the following:
- People expect an empty line to be equivalent to a line that contains nothing.
  I have never seen for example a language (except for Whitespace :) ) where is
  matters. I guess there are some file formats, where is does, but they are not
  for human editing. (Like RFC 2822. [1])
- Better user experience, I guess.

== Cons ==

=== RFC ===

Now we are compatible with RFC 2822, which says [1]:

<span class="raw-block">  2.2.3. Long Header Fields

    Each header field is logically a single line of characters comprising
    the field name, the colon, and the field body.  For convenience
    however, and to deal with the 998/78 character limitations per line,
    the field body portion of a header field can be split into a multiple
    line representation; this is called "folding".  The general rule is
    that wherever this standard allows for folding white space (not
    simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP.  For
    example, the header field:

            Subject: This is a test

    can be represented as:

            Subject: This
             is a test

    Note: Though structured field bodies are defined in such a way that
    folding can take place between many of the lexical tokens (and even
    within some of the lexical tokens), folding SHOULD be limited to
    placing the CRLF at higher-level syntactic breaks.  For instance, if
    a field body is defined as comma-separated values, it is recommended
    that folding occur after the comma separating the structured items in
    preference to other places where the field could be folded, even if
    it is allowed elsewhere.

    The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
    of a header field to its single line representation is called
    "unfolding". Unfolding is accomplished by simply removing any CRLF
    that is immediately followed by WSP.  Each header field should be
    treated in its unfolded form for further syntactic and semantic
    evaluation.
</span>
If we handle lines only with whitespace as empty lines, we will drop this
compatibility.

=== Work ===

My solution (my commit) is only temporary, because it does not allow certain
attributes with empty lines (these will be regarded as the end of that
attribute). If we want to make a good solution, we should think and work. We
could use backslashes at the end of lines, but then we should escape them in the
subject, as well:

<span class="raw-block">    Original subject:
        This is a \/ nice subject.
        Very nice.

    Subject in post file:
        Subject: This is a \\/ nice subject.\
        Very nice.

    Current solution:
        Subject: This is a \/ nice subject.
         Very nice.
</span>
=== Rigidity, which is our principle ===

I think the other pros and cons are more serious, than this one.

Hey, this sounds like a bug in Vim!

But you are right; this shouldn't harm people trying to follow the
tutorial.
