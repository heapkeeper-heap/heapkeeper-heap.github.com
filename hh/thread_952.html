<pre class="postbody">I am in the middle of reviewing Csabi's commits. For the commmits I
had a note or question about, I added an annotated tag.

What do you think, is it OK to push these tags to my repository? Then,
we could discuss them, and delete. Or, we could just discuss them on
the heap. In this case, I'd keep these tags private, and delete them
as soon as the thread is opened on the heap.

</span></span>I decided to stay with the second. This is not exactly what tags are
meant for, and I don't want to clutter up the repository with them.
Anyway, if you want to answer them, you have to open a thread on the
heap, so why not do it myself?
