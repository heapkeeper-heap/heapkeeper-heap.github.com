The following method should be used to decide whether post1 or post2
is greater:
- If both of them have a timestamp and these are not equal, the post
 with the later timestamp is greater.
- Otherwise the post with the greater heapid is the greater.

This should be implemented in the Post class, and PostSet.sorted_list
should use this. (Currently PostSet.sorted_list uses a different way
to compare the posts).

have this rule:

<pre class="postbody">Sorry, but I dislike this idea a lot. People can edit the post files,
and manage them in repositories -- the VCS would have complicated
effects on Hk's internal stuff (post order).

Using the heapid when the posts have no timestamps will cause the same
ordering on all systems that have the same heap. This is not true for
using timestamps _of_ the post files -- maybe we have the same heap,
but managed the files differently, so we have a different order.

Do you have a use case when it would be useful?

</span></span>Not really, it was just an idea.

</span></span>You are definitely right here.

</span></span>I don't know how VCSs handle _creation_ time. But you are right, we
cannot build on it, too volatile, besides, I think Windows has no such
concept.

OK then, let's stay at your suggestion.
