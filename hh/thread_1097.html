<pre class="postbody">Maybe you misunderstood my original problem. In Hk posts, the trailing
whitespace should never be valid if it matches /[^ ]\s\+$/. (That is,
the only acceptable situation is a line that is only whitespace, and
nothing else.) See for example this:

    #include &lt;stdio&gt;

    int main() {}

If I write this, if we ever do any syntax highlighting, this will show
up as two distinct code blocks.

There is an alternate solution: we could declare that adjacent code
blocks are to be interpreted as continuous including any empty lines,
but then we'd have to include a separator element, e.g. a special "no-op"
meta. Like this:

    Compare these two examples:&lt;cr&gt;
    &lt;cr&gt;
    &lt;spc&gt;print 'hello world'&lt;cr&gt;
    [sep]&lt;cr&gt;
    &lt;spc&gt;print('hello world')&lt;cr&gt;

Here, the "sep" meta generates no output, but it prevents the output
from containing a single code block with 3 lines, the one 2nd empty,
as it would happen otherwise.

Of course this meta doesn't do anything, so it could be called "nop",
but then its purpose wouldn't be so evident. Maybe we could say that
"nop" and "sep" are synonyms for the same meta.

</span></span>Not really :)

</span></span>That's what Sphinx does. (And that's what Pyhon does as well, if you
think about it.)

&gt;    [sep]&lt;cr&gt;
&gt;    &lt;spc&gt;print('hello world')&lt;cr&gt;

</span></span>We would have to include it if we wanted to be able to express
everything, including your example. I don't think it it important to
be able to express that. For example, in Sphinx, you would put the two
code examples into an itemization:

    Compare these two examples:

    - ::

        print 'hello world'&lt;cr&gt;

    - ::

        print('hello world')&lt;cr&gt;

But we can say that we will add a separator later if we seem to need it.

</span></span>At first I found it very hard to accept such a thought...

</span></span>...but this seemed to comfort me. After all, a Heap free of trailing
whitespace is not an insignificant gain.

So I agree.

</span></span>Especially if you consider that git warns about trailing white spaces
when merging patches by default.

</span></span>Good :)
