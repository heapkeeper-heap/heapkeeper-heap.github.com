<pre class="postbody">== Basic idea ==

We should implement a search facility in Heapkeeper. The user would
give a few words to Hk, and it would find posts that contain all of
those words.

== More specific specification ==

I propose to use regular expressions. So if a user searches for the
following word sequence:

    word1 word2 word3

the resulted postset would be equal to the result of the following
program:

    def contains(word):
        """Returns a function that can decide whether a given post
        contains the given word."""
        def f(post):
            return (re.search(word, post.body()) or
                    re.search(word, post.author())
                    re.search(word, post.subject()) or
                    re.search(word, ' '.join(post.tags())))
        return f

    postdb.all().collect(contains("word1")). \
                 collect(contains("word2")). \
                 collect(contains("word3"))

(This is not the implementation, this is only the specification :) )

The would could be regular expressions, if the user wants to use them.

== Advanced features ==

The following features are only ideas, I don't propose to implement
them in the first go.

=== Ranking ===

We could implement ranking so that a post will be higher in the
search results if the word is present as a tag/keyword/subject. Or a
post will be lower in the results if the expression is present only in
a quote.

=== Thread search ===

We could also implement "thread search", which would return only one
post per thread.

=== Generation output ===

We should make a generator that would generate HTML pages with the
search results, inlining the relevant posts, highlighting the found
expressions, etc.

=== Hkweb integration ===

And of course we should have a textbox and a "Search" button on hkweb.

=== Vim integration ===

We could feed the results into Vim so that Vim could jump between the
hits in its usual way (:cnext, :cprev, :clist).

== Effort estimation ==

This only concerns the basic features. We could spent an arbitrary
amount of time with the advanced ones :)

equal weight?

</span></span>This one seems useful, too.

An idea: how about adding a `root()` function to the shell? Or to
`hklib.PostSet`? It would return a post set which contains the root
posts of any threads from which at least one post was present in the
original post set.

Then we could have this feature like this:

    root(grep('dead trees'))

or

    grep('dead trees').root()

would be needed for your next idea, however.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; === Hkweb integration ===
&gt;

</span></span>Definitely. Together with all the highlighting you mentioned in the
previous idea.

</span></span>Wow. That'd be awesome!

I have to admit I've never used this functions, though.

&gt;
&gt; This only concerns the basic features. We could spent an arbitrary

</span></span>But ranking and thread search would come quite cheap. And the multi-word
lookup feature would also be useful. For example, I would have used it
today if it were easily available, but I rather used an alternative
solution instead.

</span></span>You mean easier than

    grep("master branch", grep("hh"))

It would not be hard to modify grep to accept

    grep("master branch", "hh")

</span></span>Never mind. It's just that at first sight, this approach seemed to do
the work, but highly inefficiently. Which would be the case if you
would have used `exp()`. But `expb()` makes it efficient.
