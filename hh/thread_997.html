<pre class="post-body-content">== Basic idea ==

We should implement a search facility in Heapkeeper. The user would
give a few words to Hk, and it would find posts that contain all of
those words.

== More specific specification ==

I propose to use regular expressions. So if a user searches for the
following word sequence:

<span class="raw-block">    word1 word2 word3
</span>
the resulted postset would be equal to the result of the following
program:

<span class="raw-block">    def contains(word):
        """Returns a function that can decide whether a given post
        contains the given word."""
        def f(post):
            return (re.search(word, post.body()) or
                    re.search(word, post.author())
                    re.search(word, post.subject()) or
                    re.search(word, ' '.join(post.tags())))
        return f

    postdb.all().collect(contains("word1")). \
                 collect(contains("word2")). \
                 collect(contains("word3"))
</span>
(This is not the implementation, this is only the specification :) )

The would could be regular expressions, if the user wants to use them.

== Advanced features ==

The following features are only ideas, I don't propose to implement
them in the first go.

=== Ranking ===

We could implement ranking so that a post will be higher in the
search results if the word is present as a tag/keyword/subject. Or a
post will be lower in the results if the expression is present only in
a quote.

=== Thread search ===

We could also implement "thread search", which would return only one
post per thread.

=== Generation output ===

We should make a generator that would generate HTML pages with the
search results, inlining the relevant posts, highlighting the found
expressions, etc.

=== Hkweb integration ===

And of course we should have a textbox and a "Search" button on hkweb.

=== Vim integration ===

We could feed the results into Vim so that Vim could jump between the
hits in its usual way (:cnext, :cprev, :clist).

== Effort estimation ==

This only concerns the basic features. We could spent an arbitrary
amount of time with the advanced ones :)

Looks useful! Would you give the tag, keyword and subject matches an
equal weight?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; === Thread search ===
&gt;
&gt; We could also implement "thread search", which would return only one
&gt; post per thread.
</span></span>
This one seems useful, too.

An idea: how about adding a `root()` function to the shell? Or to
`hklib.PostSet`? It would return a post set which contains the root
posts of any threads from which at least one post was present in the
original post set.

Then we could have this feature like this:

<span class="raw-block">    root(grep('dead trees'))
</span>
or

<span class="raw-block">    grep('dead trees').root()

</span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; === Generation output ===
&gt;
&gt; We should make a generator that would generate HTML pages with the
&gt; search results, inlining the relevant posts, highlighting the found
&gt; expressions, etc.
</span></span>
Nice -- but sounds like an awful lot of work. It sounds like this
would be needed for your next idea, however.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; === Hkweb integration ===
&gt;
&gt; And of course we should have a textbox and a "Search" button on hkweb.
</span></span>
Definitely. Together with all the highlighting you mentioned in the
previous idea.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; === Vim integration ===
&gt;
&gt; We could feed the results into Vim so that Vim could jump between the
&gt; hits in its usual way (:cnext, :cprev, :clist).
</span></span>
Wow. That'd be awesome!

I have to admit I've never used this functions, though.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; == Effort estimation ==
&gt;
&gt; This only concerns the basic features. We could spent an arbitrary
&gt; amount of time with the advanced ones :)
</span></span>
But ranking and thread search would come quite cheap. And the multi-word
lookup feature would also be useful. For example, I would have used it
today if it were easily available, but I rather used an alternative
solution instead.

Have you used :cw or :cope? They use the same error list.

You mean easier than

<span class="raw-block">    grep("master branch", grep("hh"))
</span>
It would not be hard to modify grep to accept

<span class="raw-block">    grep("master branch", "hh")

I like how you totally disregard how something works as long as it
does the work. No, I'm not sarcastic: I really like it. I think it is
the mathematician within you. Like how the mathematician makes tea. :) [1]

I think this one is incorrect. It should do `expb()` instead of `expf()`

Never mind. It's just that at first sight, this approach seemed to do
the work, but highly inefficiently. Which would be the case if you
would have used `exp()`. But `expb()` makes it efficient.
