<div class="body">
<pre class="postbody">I have optimized the email downloading algorithm of hklib. The reason
why the previous implementation was so slow is that it performed many
queries. 3 server queries were performed for each new message, and 1
query for each message already present. Now only two queries are
performed:
- download all Message-Ids
- download all heads and bodies for new messages (if any)

This of course speeds up the process enormously, and also has the
advantage that we can tell the user the number of new messages before
downloading (so she can decide if it's worth taking a coffee break).

Downloading all the messages from the INBOX looks like this (with an
empty mail directory):

    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    Connected
    Checking...
    942 new messages found.
    Downloading...
    942 new messages downloaded.
    dl: 41.591412 seconds.

Checking for new messages is very fast:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    Connected
    Checking...
    No new messages.
    dl: 1.871119 seconds.

This means we can un-archive all messages back into INBOX, so we won't
have to explain ourselves to anyone who wants to download the whole
heap into an empty mail directory.

<pre class="postbody">Nice job!

I have some comments though.

== If `emails` is "", don't do anything ==

The old code contained the following code (hklib.py:1753):

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; -        emails = self._server.search(None, '(ALL)')[1][0].strip()
&gt; -        if emails != '':
&gt; -            for email_index in emails.split(' '):
&gt; -                ...

</span></span>Which was replaced by this (hklib.py:1757):

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        all_emails = self._server.search(None, '(ALL)')[1][0].strip().split(' ')
&gt; +        if len(all_emails) == 0:
&gt; +            log('Message box is empty.')
&gt; +            return

</span></span>This is buggy I think and will result in an exception when the mailbox
is empty. ''.split(' '), returns [''] and not []:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'email1 email2'.split(' ')
    ['email1', 'email2']
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'email1'.split(' ')
    ['email1']
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.split(' ')
    ['']

I don't think it is logical for split to return [''], that's why I
checked the result of strip(). That way the produced code would be
more readable, because the reader does not have to know that split('')
returns [''].

Please, fix the bug. (Or prove that the code is not buggy :) ) I leave
it to you to decide whether you examine the result of `strip` or you
compare the result of `split` to [''].

== Other ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        emails = [mail for mail in all_emails if int(mail) &gt;= lower_value]

</span></span>Could you put spaces around brackets that mark list generators? Like
this:

    emails = [ mail for mail in all_emails if int(mail) &gt;= lower_value ]

Also, I would call the `mail` variable `email`.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        emails_imap = ','.join(emails)
&gt; +
&gt; +        log('Checking...')
&gt; +
&gt; +        result = self._server.fetch(emails_imap,
&gt; +                                    '(BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (MESSAGE-ID)])')[1]
&gt; +        raw_messids = [result[2*x][1] for x in range(len(emails))]

</span></span>Same here with the spaces. Also, the convention in Python (and in many
other languages) is to write "2 * x" and not "2*x".

Also, the convention is to call "unnamed" integer loop variables `i`.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        messids = [email.message_from_string(s)['Message-Id']
&gt; +                   for s in raw_messids]

</span></span>Same here with the spaces.

BTW, if you had to break it into lines, do it the way you just did :)

Or another acceptable way is this:

    emails_messids = \
        [ (emails[x], messids[x]) for x in range(len(emails))]

But the first one (yours) is usually more readable IMO.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        emails_messids = [(emails[x], messids[x]) for x in range(len(emails))]
&gt; +
&gt; +        # assembling a list of new messages
&gt; +        download_list = []
&gt; +        for index, messid in emails_messids:

</span></span>You can use the zip function so that you don't need the
`emails_messids` variable:

    for index, messid in zip(emails, messids):

zip creates a tuple-list from two lists that have the same length:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; zip([1,2,3], ['a','b','c'])
    [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +            post = self._postdb.post_by_messid(messid)
&gt; +            if post == None:
&gt; +                download_list.append(index)
&gt; +#            else:
&gt; +#                log('Post #%s (#%s in INBOX) found.' %
&gt; +#                    (post.heapid(), int(index) + lower_value))

</span></span>You can delete the `else` branch.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        download_imap = ','.join(download_list)
&gt; +        num_new = len(download_list)
&gt; +
&gt; +        if num_new == 0:
&gt; +            log('No new messages.')
&gt; +            return
&gt; +        else:
&gt; +            log('%d new messages found.' % num_new)

</span></span>Maybe we need a hkutils.plural function so that you can write this:

    log('%d new message%s found.' %
        (num_new, (hkutils.plural(num_new))

What do you think? I know it would be trivial (you basically
implemented it a few lines below).

If you feel like, please do it! But don't forget to document and test
it :) This is a nice and simple function, where the documentation and
testing are easy enough so that it is ideal for you to learn how to do
them. Also, the documentation and testing module for hkutils are fine,
they are both according to the current convention. This is
unfortunately not true for hklib. [1] If you document hkutils.plural,
you should also modify doc/hkutils.rst; you will see how. Another
note: hkutils.plural's implementation should be a different commit
from this one.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +
&gt; +        log('Downloading...')
&gt; +
&gt; +        result = self._server.fetch(download_imap,
&gt; +                                    '(BODY[TEXT] BODY[HEADER])')[1]
&gt; +        for n in range(num_new):

</span></span>Again, please use `i`.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +            text = result[n*3][1]
&gt; +            header = result[n*3 + 1][1]

</span></span>Again, "n * 3" (or rather "i * 3" :) )

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +            post = self.parse_email(header, text)
&gt; +            self._postdb.add_new_post(post)
&gt; +#            log('Post #%s (#%s in INBOX) downloaded.' %
&gt; +#                (post.heapid(), download_list[n]))

</span></span>You can delete the comment.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; +        log('%d new message%s downloaded.' %
&gt; +            (num_new, 's' if num_new &gt; 1 else ''))

</span></span>== parse_email ==

What do you say to creating a static Post.from_email method, which
would contain much of the code of EmailDownloader.parse_email? The
only code that cannot be simply placed into Post.from_email is the end
of EmailDownloader.parse_email:


    if self._config.has_section('nicknames'):
        for entry, author_regex in self._config.items('nicknames'):
            [author, regex] = \
                self._config.get('nicknames', entry).split(' ',1)
            if re.search(regex, post.author()) != None:
                post.set_author(author)
                break

The best solution I can come up with is that the Post.parse_email
sets the author of the post as it finds in the email, and
EmailDownloader.parse_email sets it afterwards to the nickname.

You don't have to do this refactoring if you don't feel like. And even
if you do it, it should be a separate commit from the previous
improvement. This also implies that you can fix the improvements of
current commit, I will pull from you, and later you may do this
refactoring.

== return value of dl() ==

What do you say to having dl() return the set of downloaded posts?
It would be nice for example from the tutorial reader's point of view
to see what are the messages downloaded.

It could be useful in other ways, too:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; new = dl()
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ls(new)
    ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; cat(new)
    ...

Again: you may do it if you feel like, and it should be a separate
commit :)

== git branches ==

What do you think, which branch should I pull your commit into, when
I think it's "perfect"? It seems that master should be used for this.
Do you agree?

I think I will make another branch, which you can review before I
merge them into master. Shall it be named "experimental", "exp",
"slave", "hcs", or something else?

[1] I guess I got Python disease: whenever I see "true", I want to
correct it to "True".

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; If you feel like, please do it! But don't forget to document and test

</span></span>Of course. But that brings up the question: which numbers are plural?
Possible answers:
- all, except 1
- all, except 1 and -1

At least we can be sure that zero is plural (which is kind of
nonsense). Plurality of fractions is even more insane. (Just think
about it: 0.999... is singular ;))

&gt;
&gt; What do you say to creating a static Post.from_email method, which

</span></span>I'm not sure. This is a question of distribution of responsibilities.
I think that everything that's email-specific should belong to
EmailDownloader. Post is already the central object of the program. We
should avoid making it a God object by maintaining limits to its
responsibilites.

all other places.

If we used the word "email" more often, I would even say importing
email with another name:

    import email as email_mod

Then you could have "email" variables.

Do you know why did I change the word "mail" to "post" everywhere?
(Mail files -&gt; post files, Mail -&gt; Post, MailDB -&gt; PostDB, etc.)
Because its plural sounds just unnatural. (Later I realized that
"post" sounds better from the of the Google Wave philosophy's point of
view .)

problem. I'm not native English, I am entitled to use bad grammar :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; If we used the word "email" more often, I would even say importing
&gt; email with another name:
&gt;
&gt;    import email as email_mod
&gt;
&gt; Then you could have "email" variables.

</span></span>Is this not bad practice in terms of code maintainability? If you do
such a thing at the beginning of the code, readers of the function
will wonder where that strange name came from.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Do you know why did I change the word "mail" to "post" everywhere?
&gt; (Mail files -&gt; post files, Mail -&gt; Post, MailDB -&gt; PostDB, etc.)
&gt; Because its plural sounds just unnatural. (Later I realized that
&gt; "post" sounds better from the of the Google Wave philosophy's point of
&gt; view .)

</span></span>I think the new terminology's real usefulness comes from emphasizing
the difference between an e-mail, that exists on an IMAP server, and a
post, that lives in the mail directory and Hk's memory.

&gt; IIRC, we had a hard limit somewhere that made us archive old emails. I
&gt; think you even wrote a post about it considering it a bug in the email
&gt; download mechanism.

</span></span>I wrote about it, indeed:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I cloned our git repository into a fresh directory, added our config file, but nothing
&gt; else, and started hkshell. No problems so far. Then, I did a 'dl()'. OK, some
&gt; messages were downloaded.
&gt;[...]
&gt; The cautious reader might have wondered why the cautious wording in the above:
&gt; "some messages were downloaded". This is the bigger problem. Right now, we
&gt; occasionally log into the heap's GMail account, and archive old messages so
&gt; that they are no longer checked for when downloading (as only Inbox is
&gt; checked).

</span></span>But a hard limit? Why? I always thought it was done just to save time.

I'd like to hear more about this, as I can't seem to find anything
about this on the heap other than my report, which already talks about
archiving like something that had already happened multiple times.

Will you send me an email or a pull request when you think it is ready

I suggest rebasing the branch. (E.g. adf3980806 should not be a
