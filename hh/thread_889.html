<pre class="postbody">In another post [1] I wrote about which form to use for post
references. This post is the description of a possible feature that is
orthogonal to the question of which post reference form we decide to
use. So I have to point out that in this post I will use the form I
proposed there.

The feature is about allowing writing "todo" instead of the post name.
(Post name is the new name for what we currently call "heapid" [2]).

Let's suppose Susan writes a post and she wants to refer to a post
that she did not yet write:

    Subject: Robot neurons

    I thought about what you wrote, and I don't like the idea. But it
    has some common points with my soul-research, which I will explain
    in a new post. [1]

    [1] usrobot/???

The problem is, what to write instead of the question marks? She wants
to send this email before the other one so that her colleagues will
receive this first, but she wants to refer to a post in the future. My
solution is that she composes both posts, writes "todo" instead of the
question marks and writes hint to Hk in the footnote about how to
identify the second post [3]:

    Subject: Robot neurons

    I thought about what you wrote, and I don't like the idea. But it
    has some common points with my soul-research, which I will explain
    in a new post. [1]

    [1] usrobot/todo
        Subject: Do robots have soul?
        root

    ----------------------------------------

    Subject: Do robots have soul?

    The short answer is no. But the long answer is very interesting,
    because...

She could even reference the other post back:

    Subject: Do robots have soul?

    When talking about robot neurons [1], I had an idea that I will
    describe here.

    The short answer to the question in the subject is no. But the
    long answer is very interesting, because...

    [1] usrobot/todo
        Subject: Robot neurons
        Body: I thought about what you wrote

Allowing this and making Hk recognize this structure would have the
following benefits:
- We could find the post reference todo-s very easily.
- The additional information would be useful even for heap
  maintainers, but its real usefulness is in writing a Hk feature that
  would recommend post candidates automatically. In Susan's first
  post, Hk's recommendation would be the root post of the thread with
  subject "Do robots have soul?". In the second case, it would search
  for a post with subject "Robot neurons" that contains "I thought
  about what you wrote" in the body. Every line here is a hint to Hk
  to help the search. If it can't use a hint, it does not care, it
  will not raise an error, just ignore the hint.
- The additional information would be useful for people who read the
  email and want to look up the reference using their email client.
- We could write "todo" when we cannot or don't want to look up the
  post id. (E.g. when we write email from our workplace and do not
  have the heap at our disposal.)

The Hk feature would first list the candidate posts for a "todo"
reference. Usually there would be only one candidate. Hk would also
offer replacing the "todos" with the candidate.

[3] I described a similar idea once. And yes, I do find myself
    sometimes in this situation. (For example now.)
