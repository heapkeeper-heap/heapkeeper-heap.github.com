<pre class="post-body-content">This was Csabi's idea:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; == return value of dl() ==
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What do you say to having dl() return the set of downloaded posts?
&gt;&gt; It would be nice for example from the tutorial reader's point of view
&gt;&gt; to see what are the messages downloaded.
</span></span>
And my response:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; OK. Sounds useful.
</span></span>
I implemented this idea today. I wanted it to work like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; new = dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    [...]
    3 new messages downloaded.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ls(new)
    &lt;101&gt; Security breach at Bander's estate  Master Robot (29987.01.01)
    &lt;102&gt; Security breach examined  RX-01 (29987.01.01)
    &lt;103&gt; Urgent command  Master Robot (29987.01.01)
</span>
I implemented it, but soon an unexpected surprise turned up:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    [...]
    3 new messages downloaded.
    PostSet([&lt;post  '101'&gt;, &lt;post '102'&gt;, &lt;post '103'&gt;])
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</span>
Such an output is unexpected and looks horrible if there are hundreds
of new posts downloaded, so it can't stay like this.

The problem is trivial. In interactive mode, if an expression's value
is not assigned to anything, it is printed. This can't be avoided to
the best of my knowledge, but three solutions came to my mind, none of
which are really elegant.

== Using two commands ==

Perhaps the most obvious solution. `dl()` would just download, `dlr()`
would return the new posts in a `PostSet`. In the implementation,
`dl()` could be a wrapper around `dlr()` that would swallow its return
value, and return ``None``.

The user can even implement this scheme in their hkrc file.

== Using a parameter to control the returned value ==

It works like this now:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    [...]
    3 new messages downloaded.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; new = dl(ps=True)
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    [...]
    3 new messages downloaded.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(new)
    3
</span>
== Using a parameter to receive the posts ==

Simple and unobtrusive, but not very elegant.

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; new = []
    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl(posts=new)
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    [...]
    3 new messages downloaded.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(new)
    3
</span>
Which one do we prefer?

Fair enough.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Which one do we prefer?
</span></span>
The second one, having a parameter specifying what the `dl` should
return.
