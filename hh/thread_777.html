&gt; anywhere...),
&gt;
&gt;    - *postitem* (:class:`PostItem`) - the PostItem being examined
&gt;    - *param* (`str`) - the name of the parameter to examine,
&gt;
&gt; would become
&gt;
&gt;    - `postitem` (|PostItem|) - the post item being examined
&gt;    - `param` (str) - the name of the parameter to examine,

</span></span>I suppose we rather name what the class represents then use the class name.

These are docstrings from `PostItem`:

    def copy(self):
        """Creates a shallow copy of the post item."""

    def __str__(self):
        """Returns the string representation of the PostItem."""

Why use "post item" in the first, and "PostItem" in the second?

I think we should have a written guideline on good docstrings before
setting out to improve them.

</span></span>The second should be "post item", as well. I'll fix it.

I use either "post item" or "PostItem object". I avoid using
"PostItem" on its own to something else than the class.

If I want to emphasize its type (because e.g. I'm writing a tutorial
and I'm introducing the reader what a "post item" is) then I use the
latter one, but otherwise I use the former one.

</span></span>I'm not sure it would make any difference.

People are lazy to read long documents and will forgot them. For
example there is <a href="http://heapkeeper.org/codingconventions.html">http://heapkeeper.org/codingconventions.html</a> which
shows that you should put function arguments in docstrings between
backticks (`) instead of stars (*), and you still put them between
stars. But I don't blame you: it is hard to remember things like this,
and people are lazy to look up information in documents like this all
the time. Probably you did what everyone else would do: you searched
for another docstring in the Python code and copied the patterns you
saw there. Which is all right IMO.

If I see you make a mistake, I'll correct you. If you see me make a
mistake, you will correct me. Sometimes we will have an argument about
what is the best thing to do. I think this is the way to go. I don't
expect anybody to know the conventions by heart.

Another advantage of this procedure is that if someone does not
correct the other person, it means they implicitly agree. So we can
talk only about the things in which we disagree (or the mistakes we
make), we don't waste our time by specifying obvious things.

Also, if I set out and write a lengthy document, it will be according
to _my_ taste, but if the conventions evolve on the heap and in the
code, it will be more _ours_. Actually, if it evolves, it will be a
very dynamic process: the more you contribute to the project, the more
effect will you have on the conventions, because the convention is
(almost by definition) the way most of the code does a certain thing.

Another reason against specifying things like when to write "post
item" and when to write "PostItem" is that it is very hard to specify
this. I don't really want to think about things like this.

Finally, the conventions change, and I don't want to constantly update
the document.

It is fine to have a small document about the most important and most
concrete conventions, but now I don't feel like writing a document
with a bunch of very specific and complicated things. Maybe as the
project grows, my opinion on this will change.
