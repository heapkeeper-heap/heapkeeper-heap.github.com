<pre class="postbody">We should build our own culture of insignificant names. C++
programmers use foo and bar. Python programmers use "spam" and "eggs"
for variable names, and they use the mixed names of members of the Monty
Python group (e.g. "John Idle" and "Eric Cleese", even though their
real name is "John Cleese" and "Eric Idle".)

We started to use our own names as example signatures, but we could
be a bit more creative.

What do you think?

</span></span>I'll like the idea. How about crediting the author with summoning whatever
fictional or real characters xe desires for such purposes? For example,
one could make up a fictional conversation between Syntus and Suputes,
Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick, or Tassadar and Aldaris, to name a few
well-known heroes. Thus, one's opportunity to advertise their taste would be
regarded as a kind of compliment for making the proposal.
