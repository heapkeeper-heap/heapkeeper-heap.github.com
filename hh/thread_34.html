<pre class="postbody">When talking about a specific commit (or commits), I suggest the
following forms for the subject:

    [hh][commit] Description (date sha)
    [hh][commit] Description (date1 sha1, date2 sha2...)

- `date` is a date in yyyy-mm-dd format, as gitk displays it. Or is
  mm-dd enough?
- `sha` is the first 10 characters of the SHA1 ID. Or should it be
  less?

E.g.:

    [hh][commit] Developer Guide (2007-03-16 f3865b0265, 2007-03-19 137486f2a0)

</span></span>With 5 digits, you have 16^5 = 2^20 = 1048576 different hashes. With
10000 non-colliding hashes, the chance of collision is about 1:100
with each new hash added. (Correct me on that if I'm wrong,
combinatorics is not exactly my forte.) So we seem to be better off
with 10 digits. (Even if I started this letter with the intent of
advocating 5 digit hashes...)

OK.

&gt; With 5 digits, you have 16^5 = 2^20 = 1048576 different hashes.

</span></span>Why do you take 16 as a base? A SHA character can be either a
lowercase letter, an uppercase letter or a digit: 26+26+10=62.
So the number of all variations with 5 digits is 62^5 = 916132832.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; With 10000 non-colliding hashes, the chance of collision is about
&gt; 1:100 with each new hash added.

</span></span>If you add a new hash, the chance of having a collision is:

    10000/916132832 = 1:91613 = .0000109154

Having no collision:

    1 - .0000109154 = .9999890846 = 99.99890846%

The chance that there is no collision between k concrete hashes when
there are n possible hashes:

    positive cases: n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)
    all cases:  n^k
    probability: positive_cases / all_cases

A small bc script that calculates the probability:

    n = 62^5
    k = 10000

    s = 1
    last = n - k + 1
    for (i=n; i&gt;=last; i--) {
        s = s * i
    }

    scale = 20
    print "The probability of NOT having collision:"
    print s/(n^k)
    print "\n"
    quit

The famous example: 30 people in a classroom, what are the chances
that there are at least two people with the same birthday?

Answer: the probability is around 71%. (n=365, k=30)

The probability of not having a collision when using 5 characters long
ids:

    94.689034994794458384%

The probability of not having a collision when using 10 characters
long ids:

    99.999999994043245827%

I was wondering about all the numbers between 1 and 10. They are as
follows:

     3:  0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000039334920%
     4:  3.3904284628652179833%
     5: 94.689034994794458384%
     6: 99.912019719070384845%
     7: 99.998580348767266275%
     8: 99.999977102239580324%
     9: 99.999999630681241958%
    10: 99.999999994043245827%

1 and 2 are effectively 0. I was wondering about 40 as well, the
number git uses. I started bc with 40, but I haven't had the patience
to wait for the result (maybe tomorrow). But you can extrapolate from
the number of 9-s in the numbers:

 number: nines
     6: 1
     6: 3
     7: 4
     8: 6
     9: 8
    10: 10
    ...
    40: 50

So it should be around:
    40: 99.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999%

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; (Correct me on that if I'm wrong, combinatorics is not exactly my
&gt; forte.)

</span></span>I see :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; So we seem to be better off with 10 digits. (Even if I started this
&gt; letter with the intent of advocating 5 digit hashes...)

</span></span>Maybe your initial feeling was right? If we work on the project for 3
years, doing 10 commits per day, commenting every single commit, and
trying to check out every single one -- we would have a 95% chance of
not having any problems. And if this collision occurred once in 3
years, then what? It will be trivial to identify which commit is the
one we were talking about by its date. (We are not talking about is it
enough to use 5-long ids by git - we are talking about using them in
the subjects of our posts.)

So, I'm in favour of 5-long ids in subjects.

</span></span>The "exact" number:
     40: 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999899246766541222762475427649806%

My estimate wasn't very bad. 63 nines instead of 50.

Another interesting thing: how many commits should we have so that we
will have a 50% chance of collision in git... My estimate: A LOT.
