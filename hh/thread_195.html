== Documentation ==

Could you provide a little info on how to use new scripts when you
commit them? You don't need to write normal documentation, but you
could have written a small example at least in the commit message.
(Which could be copied in the documentation later.) Something like
this would have been enough:

<span class="raw-block">  The scripts/stat script executes the given hkshell command given
  times.

  An example:

    $ scripts/stat gp 5
    average: 0.000153, SD: 0.000000

  In the example, the gp() command is executed 5 times. Afterwards,
  the the result of the measurement is printed: the average executing
  time of the gp() commands was 0.000153 seconds, while the square
  deviation was 0.000000.
</span>
Don't be afraid that writing longer commit messages is a waste of
time, I will read all them happily :) It takes you 1 minute to write a
commit message like this, and it save me 5 minutes of thinking about
what were you doing.

Or it would be even better if the script printed a help text when
invoked with "--help", like I did in scripts/pushdoc. (I have just
corrected pushdoc -- I have just realized that its handling of
"--help" was buggy :) )

== Minor improvement idea ==

<span class="raw-block">  --------------------------------- scripts/stat ---------------------------------
  +  #!/bin/bash
  +
  +  ./hkshell 'on("t")' "for i in range($2): $1()" 'q()' | grep "^$1" | cut -d " " -f 2 | scripts/stat.py
</span>
I would write

<span class="raw-block">    grep "^$1:"
</span>
instead of

<span class="raw-block">    grep "^$1"
</span>
You never know :)

<pre class="post-body-content">OK, help included. Also updated the maths: it now calculates the
standard deviation, not the squared deviation. (Not that it matters
much to me.)
