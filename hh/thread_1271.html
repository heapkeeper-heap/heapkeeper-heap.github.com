<pre class="post-body-content">I've been studying the code of `hkshell`, and I've noticed several
customization frameworks, namely:
- options/features,
- events and listeners,
- callbacks.

I understand that the options-features system and the events-listeners
systems represent a higher and a lower level of customizability,
respectively, where features are actually implemented as event
listeners. That much I understand, and I also very much like the idea.

What I don't understand is how callbacks fit into this picture. After
some studying, it seems to me that callbacks serve as hook points that
enable `hkrc` code to more easily tell `hkshell` what to do.

While this may be the only usable way in a more rigid language,
Python is much more flexible than that. Say, that we, the developers
recognize that many users need to personalize the generation of
indices. Fine, let's help them by making it a callback, which means
that `hkshell` provides a space where `hkrc` code can freely express
its opinion on how this operation needs to be performed.

First of all, I would like to ask for confirmation if this really is
what Csabi had in mind when designing the callbacks feature.

If I got it right so far, here is my concern: I feel that it is
somewhat pointless to provide hook points for `hkrc` to customize
`hkshell`. Due to the fact that `hkrc`s are Python modules that are
imported after `hkshell`, they are free to do whatever they please
with the `hkshell` module.  As an example, my `hkrc` wraps a `hkshell`
global variable to enhance its functionality. It would be just as easy
and efficient to specify one's own `gen_indices()` function like this:

<span class="raw-block">    import hkshell

    def my_gen_indices():
        # do really wild stuff
        ...

    hkshell.gen_indices = my_gen_indices
</span>
One might argue that this is not very nice to other modules. We may
load more than one "hkrc" module, and if each works like this, only
the last will have its way. But the way callbacks are implemented
right now also doesn't solve this -- but it could with not much
additional effort, all we'd have to do is store callback functions in
a list and call them sequentially.

But then, this system becomes enormously similar to events. The
`gen_indices` callback would become a `gen_indices` event, and any
number of listeners may subscribe to this event, and do their job one
after another.

Another problem with callbacks is that they require providence from
the core developers to allow for customization. Using the "overloading"
technique I presented before, it is possible to perform customizations
the need for which the core developers never would have imagined.

Therefore, I am arguing for the abolishment of callbacks in favor of
event handlers or direct manipulation of the `hkshell` module object
by `hkrc` code. Csabi, what do you think?

A better itemization would be, according to the logic of the code:
- options and callbacks
- events and listeners
- features

The options-callbacks system is totally separate from events-listeners
features. Options-callbacks is for simpler customization
(configuration variables and callbacks functions, see later), while
events-listeners-features are more complicated, and they implement the
two-level architecture that you noticed.

The options-callbacks are inherently simple. The only difference
between an option and a callback is that when a configuration can be
easily described with data, that is an option; when in can be
described only in code, that is a callback.

The events-listeners are inherently complex, so the "features" were
created to hide this complexity.

A few concrete questions of yours, which can be answered considering
the few paragraphs above:

Change the expression "options-features system" to "features system"
and your sentence will be correct.

You do understand it then :)

</span></span>
Yes, that's what I had in mind: configuring hkshell how to do certain
things. But there is an important point here: it is only about
hkshell, not about hklib.

== The new design for customizing Heapkeeper ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; If I got it right so far, here is my concern: I feel that it is
&gt; somewhat pointless to provide hook points for `hkrc` to customize
&gt; `hkshell`.
</span></span>
You have a point there. Let me give you a bit of background.

Traditional programs usually use configuration variables and callback
functions to allow customization. (Configuration variables are used
when the customization can be described with a data structure,
callback functions are used when a data structure is not enough and a
function is needed.)

I used this approach when I started developing Heapkeeper, that's why
we have the Options class and the Callback class. (Options stores the
configuration variables, while Callback stored the callback
functions.) These is also what I initially used for the Generator
class.

When I implemented the new Generator in v0.4, I created a new way of
customization for it. The new way is that there are no explicit points
of the program to be customized (like a configuration variable or a
callback function), but the user can redefine any method to achieve
any kind of customizations. (In Generator's case, this can be done by
either subclassing the Generator or monkey-patching it.)

The drawback of the old design is exactly what you say:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Another problem with callbacks is that they require providence from
&gt; the core developers to allow for customization. Using the
&gt; "overloading" technique I presented before, it is possible to
&gt; perform customizations the need for which the core developers never
&gt; would have imagined.
</span></span>
The drawback of the new design is that it is much easier to break
someone's customization, because we don't have an explicitly defined
interface which we (the core developers) could be careful not to
change. In the new design, we can of course say that we won't just
delete any method between two versions but make it so that everything
that worked in version x without a warning will also work in version
x+1, but may give a warning (and therefore may not work in version
x+2). This way all method removals have to be done in two releases
instead of one. This could prevent our users being in a situation
where something just stopped working and they have no idea why.
(Providing that they will not skip any version but upgrade always only
one version.)

I think that in our stage, the advantages of the new design (more
customization with less work) are more important than its
disadvantages (not having a clear and explicit interface for
customization).

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Therefore, I am arguing for the abolishment of callbacks in favor of
&gt; event handlers or direct manipulation of the `hkshell` module object
&gt; by `hkrc` code. Csabi, what do you think?
</span></span>
I would be in favor of introducing this new design to be introduced to
hkshell in case of callbacks. This means I choose your second option:
the direct manipulation of hkshell. This will also make the code more
readable.

Currently:
- we have a hkcustomlib.gen_indices function
- hkshell.Callbacks.gen_indices points to this function by default
- we have a hkshell.options.callbacks which is a hkshell.Callbacks
  instance
- we invoke hkshell.options.callbacks.gen_indices in hkshell when we
  want to execute it

With the new design, it would be a simple hkshell function, and that's
it. Customizing hkshell with the new design would be a bit more
unconventional than customizing the Generator with the new design:
methods are overridden more often than global functions. But anyway, I
support your idea here.

== The similarity of callbacks and events ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; But then, this system becomes enormously similar to events. The
&gt; `gen_indices` callback would become a `gen_indices` event, and any
&gt; number of listeners may subscribe to this event, and do their job
&gt; one after another.
</span></span>
I don't understand this. Every function call is similar to an event.
I don't get why would gen_indices be more similar than any other
function call. If you propose that hkshell.g() should just trigger a
'gen_indices' event and do nothing else, I dislike that idea. Events
are for code parts where we have no idea what the subscribers want to
do. We should use events only when really necessary, because code that
uses events and listeners is much harder to read and understand that
code that uses function calls.
