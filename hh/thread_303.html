<pre class="post-body-content">Do you know free web page hosting services that also make us easy to
buy a domain? (The domain will not be free of course.) I think of
the homepage of Hk. We have only static HTML pages, that could be
enough.

For example with uw [1], the hosting and a domain would be 6000 HUF +
VAT / year, i.e. around 37$/yr. But I know uw is not the best. Do you
know alternatives?

I had a look at Google Apps on how easy it is to store static web
pages. I registered the "heapkeeper" Google App domain. Well, static
HTML pages can be copied and shown, but I haven't manage to do it
nicely: you have to write "/static/index.html" after the domain. [2]

Yes, I do. At newhosting.hu, hosting is free, and the domain costs
about 2000 HUF / year. Also free of advertisements, and PHP and MySQL
are included. Definitely worth looking.

Can you use FTP to upload files?

.hu is around 2000 HUF, others (com, org) are 3000 HUF. But still nice
prices.

I like it! Shall I register a domain name and an account?

No. I was looking for it and someone explicitly stated this. The
Google App SDK works from command line, though, so it can be
automatized.

Me too. FTP access is a bit quirky (@ in the username...), but it
works nonetheless.

Cool! Can we be "www.heapkeeper.org"?

Probably they want to discourage static use. (Though beats me why they
would want to encourage putting load on their servers...)

</span></span>
Yes, that was in my mind, too :)

Although POSS says that we should also book heapkeeper.com and
heapkeeper.net [1]:

<span class="raw-block">    "[A good project name,] if possible, is available as a domain name
    in the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains. You should pick
    one, probably .org, to advertise as the official home site for the
    project; the other two should forward there and are simply to
    prevent third parties from creating identity confusion around the
    project's name."
</span>
I don't think that is urgent now. Do you think it is worth it? I think
the .com one is more important than the .net one.

Both heapkeeper.org [2] and heapkeeper.com [3] are available.

No, at least not until we get at least some traffic.

The choice of name was fine, and this is beginning to pay off. The
only other Heapkeeper Google seems to know about lives in Second Life
in a virtual post-apocalypse area called Junkyard. And even that one
can't be too well-known since our GitHub repository is the first hit.
