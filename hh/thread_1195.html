<pre class="post-body-content">Post <a href="../hh/thread_890.html#post-summary-hh-890">heap://890</a> describes the roadmap that we planned for v0.4 and
v0.5. Everything is done that we planned for v0.5 except for setting
up a server to make automatic commits of new posts, but I don't feel
that as an urgent task.

So I propose merging the _several_heaps and _docs branches into the
master, testing the release candidate branch for two weeks, and
finally releasing Heapkeeper v0.5. I would be glad if Attis also
tested Heapkeeper's newest version during this period.

I don't know whether we should announce Heapkeeper on Freshmeat or
we should wait another release.

Opinions?

You're right: not urgent, but I'd still love to have it, and it's been
planned since about a year ago. But I understand that there are more
important things to do.

If you have the RC branch, I'll gladly help with the testing.

</span></span>
Do you have any set of features or goals that would have to be
fulfilled to consider the project mature enough to go public? I have a
constant fear that no-one will understand what we wanted to build
unless we can provide a Web interface and database storage. But we can
release nonetheless -- who knows, maybe someone will volunteer to do
it for us :)

Basically _several_heaps is the RC branch. The _docs branch contains
improvements about the development process (how to use pylint for
example). After some testing of _several_heaps, they should be merged
and the merged branch will be the real RC branch.

The only such feature was supporting several heaps :)

And we are public in some ways (homepage, public repository), so
appearing in Freshmeat is not that huge a step.

</span></span>
You are right in saying that Heapkeeper will be easier to understand
if we support those. But my fear in that if we wait for those, we
won't go to Freshmeat in 2010. (Bear in mind, we started the project
in October 2008.)

</span></span>
OK then :)
