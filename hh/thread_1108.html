Would you quote something when you change the subject? Changing the
subject makes the thread to break on GMail's web interface.

Sorry. I wanted to pay attention to this, and I thought I did, but
just before sending, I added the part after the colon. Of course this
is a reply to the thread with the subject "Running hk with different
profiles".

Gmail sucks.

Gmail sucks even worse: it seems long threads are broken even if the
subject doesn't change:

<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=2c3a7bdcd247a2e4&hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=2c3a7bdcd247a2e4&amp;hl=en</a>

A blogger has commented on this while Gmail was young:

<a href="http://www.bladam.com/main/entry/gmail-revolutionizing-mail">http://www.bladam.com/main/entry/gmail-revolutionizing-mail</a>

"- Greater sensitivity to the subject line
On one hand, I think people may be reluctant to change the subject
line in an ongoing conversation for fear of 'breaking' the
conversation (I actually got hollered at by a friend for doing just
that).

But on the other hand, I believe folks may perhaps become more
sensitive to the realities of both personal and public (discussion
list) conversations floating to wildly different topics... and feel
compelled to change the subject to split the conversation. Of course,
Google's implementation (or not) of conversation joining/splitting
tools will certainly have an effect on all of this as well."

Gmail sucks because it wants to correct others' mistakes. For example
this guy complains that editing the subject line is not easy:

"There's a few problems with this. First is order-of-operation
problems. A common way for me (and a lot of other users) to compose a
new message is by replying to a message from the person I want to
mail, and change the subject line. I do it this way because it's the
fastest way to send an email to someone who's not in the address book.
But with gmail hiding the subject line behind a hard-to-spot link,
this common scenerio gets tossed into the food processor."

<a href="http://hanfordlemoore.com/v/gmail-arrow-of-mystery-and-subject-line">http://hanfordlemoore.com/v/gmail-arrow-of-mystery-and-subject-line</a>

I guess scrapping this way of sending mail is what they wanted to achieve!

Another interesting point among the comments:

'I did a test and checked the headers. Gmail removes the "in-reply-to"
tag if I change the subject line in a reply. Even if there's quoted
text from the old message. I'm not doing anything wrong by using
"reply" to start a new email.

I think this is the right move. The whole concept of the "thread" as a
property independent of "Subject" is just too abstract for it to
matter to everyday users. It's hidden, and it's irrelevant. To the
majority of email users the Subject is the thread (give of take "re:"s
and "fwd:"s) , and when the subject changes, the thread should too. I
have a hunch that if Gmail supported to threading the way Enno
describes it, the masses would have a fit.'

1. We should also do these tests.
2. Masses should be empowered by the knowledge of proper e-mail threading.
3. Not everyone is stupid.

All this may result in my keeping Gmail as an e-mail provider, but
drifting away from their (otherwise great) UI.
