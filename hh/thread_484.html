<pre class="postbody">We have a bug in the newest Hk (as of 2009-08-09). If you look at UMS
Heap's post 1287, the thread summary says:

    Csabi subjects should ... [hh,... prop, reviewed] &lt;1287&gt; (2009.03.07.)
    Attis subjects should ... [hh,... prop, reviewed] &lt;1410&gt; (2009.03.19.)
    Csabi subjects should ... [hh,... prop, reviewed] &lt;1414&gt; (2009.03.20.)
    Attis subjects should ... [hh,... prop, reviewed] &lt;1455&gt; (2009.03.23.)

    Csabi Subjects should ... [hh,... prop] &lt;1796&gt; (2009.05.10.)

While looking at thread 1287, the thread summary page lists:

    Csabi subjects should ... [hh,... reviewed] &lt;1287&gt;
    Attis subjects should ... [hh,... reviewed] &lt;1410&gt;
    Csabi subjects should ... [hh,... reviewed] &lt;1414&gt;
    Attis subjects should ... [hh,... reviewed] &lt;1455&gt;
    Attis Subjects should ... [hh,...] &lt;2237&gt;
    Csabi Subjects should ... [hh,...] &lt;2238&gt;
    Attis Subjects should ... [hh,...] &lt;2239&gt;
    Csabi Subjects should ... [hh,...] &lt;2240&gt;

The second half of the thread is not the same. This means two things:
- the thread summary is generated differently in these cases,
- there is a bug in the download mechanism, and duplicate posts are
  in the database

<pre class="postbody">== Problem ==

You found a real bug in Heapkeeper's post file parser, which was introduced by
me in commit 779f05bff7. I was aware of the bug, but I did not think it would
reveal itself. There are some posts with subjects ending with newlines, which
is insane (also introduced by me), which made it happen.

There seems to be some posts like post 1793. I introduced an additional newline
into the subject of these posts in commit a3f92; I don't know, how and why.

But git does not lie:

    -From: Attis
    +Author: Attis
     Subject: Subjects should start with capital
       letter
    +
     Tag: hh
     Tag: hh-conventions
     Tag: prop
     Message-Id: &lt;b29f917d0905101016k7de25884p8587e99565fb9cc@mail.gmail.com&gt;
    -In-Reply-To: &lt;b29f917d0903191129w3b774b86u1abe719903820d1c@mail.gmail.com&gt;
    +Parent: &lt;b29f917d0903191129w3b774b86u1abe719903820d1c@mail.gmail.com&gt;
     Date: Sun, 10 May 2009 19:16:18 +0200

     &gt; Uppercase? Somehow deep in my heart I wished this to come out
to lowercase...

The original subject was:

    "Subjects should start with capital\n letter"

The new subject is:

    "Subjects should start with capital\n letter\n"

The final "\n" means an *empty line that contains only a space* in the post
file. In a previous thread [1] we discussed that I modified the parser so that
it will consider empty lines and empty lines containing only whitespace to be
equivalent. This caused the problem: the new parser will stop at the empty line
of the header of post 1793, and will consider all the rest (tag and parent
information included) to be part of the body. You can see it if you click in
the post page.

</span></span>Nope, there is no bug in the download mechanism, this failure is the
consequence of the described bug. Post 1793 seemed to have no message id, so
the email in the Google Inbox that had the same message id got downloaded, and
post 2237 were created from it.

== Solution ==

One solution regarding Hk is to go back right to the previous, conservative
parsing mechanism. As keen I was to promote the new parser, now I think that we
should go back to the original parser until we know better.

Nevertheless, the ugly subjects have to be fixed. And your repository have to
be fixed with its duplicate posts. I advise you to do the following:
- Go to the head of my repo that I just sent in a non-heap email.
- Create patches for aa62fbc0c8 and 2a20faccdf5d. Remove the downloading part
  (as opposed to the tidying part) of the latter.
- Apply them to the head of my repo.

As far as I saw, you did not edit newly downloaded posts, which would make us
much harder to merge our repos and fix the problems.

</span></span>Yes it is, I forgot about this yesterday. The thread page generating
code contains a bunch of copy paste code to walk the thread structure.
I want to write a generic thread structure walking function that can
be used for thread page generation, post page generation etc. When I
do that, I'll try to investigate what is the reason of this behavior.
