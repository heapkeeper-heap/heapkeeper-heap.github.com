I know that in the past I've committed many atrocities against the
sanity of the repository, but recently I've learnt much about Git. So
if your primary motive is to keep your repository clean, I can promise
I won't disturb that.

But I have no objections to adopting such a workflow either. So I'm
neutral to the idea, which means that I can be convinced easily :)

</span></span>I am curious about how that workflow works in practice, and I would be
more confident in advocating that workflow and asking potential
contributors to use that.

</span></span>To be honest, that was one of my motives :)

</span></span>To sum up:
- it seems to be the normal workflow on github
- I'm wondering how that works
- would be useful in the future (new contributors will not feel
second-class citizens if they don't get access to hcs42/heapkeeper)

</span></span>That is a strong argument. So I guess it's time for me to put my pride
aside so that the project can grow most efficiently.

I'm also curious about this experiment. So, let's give it a try!

<pre class="postbody">Thanks for your cooperation :)

Do you think we should try out in sandbox repos how this works so that
we won't make silly mistakes again which would force us to delete and
upload the repository again? For example I'm wondering how easily can
I to reorganize (rebase) your commits instead of just pulling them. Or
if I think something should be done in a different way, how easy it
for you to change it so that I can pick it again and my history will
be still fine.

Or shall we practice a few weeks on the real repo, and wait a few
weeks with 0.3, so that we can delete and upload the repository again
if we screw up something?

</span></span>It may be a pain, but we'll see.

</span></span>I don't know. Releasing 0.3 could be a mistake if we later decide to
un-release it. We should keep the repo sacred after 'going public',
and choosing the workflow seems to be a requirement for a stable
repository.

I guess you should fork it and clone it to your local machine. I can't
work it as I am the owner (stupid rule, eh?) So I think I will create
another account, just to play around with forking and pulling.
