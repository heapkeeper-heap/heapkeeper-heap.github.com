<pre class="postbody">When a thread's topic silently diverges, the thread has to be broken
by the editors to match the topic shift.

The situation is easy when the topic change happens precisely at post
boundaries. Eg. post 123 is about cats, and post 124, the reply to
123, suddenly changes the topic to nuclear warfare. While on post 125
and onwards continue the peaceful discussion about furry felines. The
way we use Heapkeeper now, the editor edits 124, removes the
In-Reply-To, and marks the post as referencing to 123, and all is
well.

The complicated situation arises when someone writes a post about
mutation caused by fallout, then adds a paragraph like "And, by the
way, I've seen a cat with 19 claws." Then, on one subthread, the
discussion proceeds into single- and double-chain DNA damages caused
by cobalt bombs, while on the other, the conversation will revolve
around the 19-clawed kittie (who, to the best of my knowledge, is dead
by now, but brobably not because of radiation poisoning).

What's the editor to do? The situation is not as simple as before.
Making the first "kitten-only" post a new thread could be done, but
then, the mutant monster would seemingly drop out of nowhere. The
mixed post must be separated, and the relevant paragraph of this mixed
post should be the first post in the cat thread. This, of course, can
be done -- but not from within heapia. You could do an "e(123)", and
strip the irrelevant paragraph out of the mostly nuke-oriented post,
but if you now create a new post file, say, x42.mail, it will not be
read into the MailDB. And, if you make the mistake of staying in
heapia, and do an "e(124)" to change the In-Reply-To: header to x42,
you'll get a nasty exception when attempting to generate HTML output.

So I think we need either:
- a command to re-read the mail database (simple and less foolproof),
- a command to facilitate the splitting of a post.

Such a splitting command could work like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; sp(123)

    (behind the scenes:) vim -O mail/123.mail mail/x42.mail

This would also spare the editor the burden of keeping track of the x-numbers.

</span></span>I have though about this, as well. I'll write a more detailed answer

</span></span>Yes, this feature would be nice, I would have used it, as well. You
can put it onto the todo list, if you want to.

</span></span>I don't understand this.

<pre class="postbody"><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Why would you say e(124)? Why would you get a nasty exception?

</span></span>In this situation, you have a post (123), which contains two topics. 125 is an
aswer to the first, the more important, so I'll leave the "125 is a reply to
123" relationship in place. 124 is the answer to the "side topic" of 123, so I
split the part of 123 which deals with this into a separate post (x42), and
modify 124 (hence e(124) ) to have this new post as its parent.

</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; I don't understand this.

</span></span>Now, when we split a post, we give the new post file an ID, which is the
letter 'x' followed by a number. If one wants to create a new post file, they
have to look at the mail directory listing to find the highest number after
the 'x' in mail files already present. This cannot be done from within heapia
as of now. This is one part of the problem I aim to solve.
