<pre class="postbody">When a thread's topic silently diverges, the thread has to be broken
by the editors to match the topic shift.

The situation is easy when the topic change happens precisely at post
boundaries. E.g. post 123 is about cats, and post 124, the reply to
123, suddenly changes the topic to nuclear warfare. While on post 125
and onwards continue the peaceful discussion about furry felines. The
way we use Heapkeeper now, the editor edits 124, removes the "Parent"
header attribute, and marks the post as referencing to 123, and all is
well.

The complicated situation arises when someone writes a post about
mutation caused by fallout, then adds a paragraph like "And, by the
way, I've seen a cat with 19 claws." Then, on one subthread, the
discussion proceeds into single- and double-chain DNA damages caused
by cobalt bombs, while on the other, the conversation will revolve
around the 19-clawed kittie (who, to the best of my knowledge, is dead
by now, but probably not because of radiation poisoning).

What's the editor to do? The situation is not as simple as before.
Making the first "kitten-only" post a new thread could be done, but
then, the mutant monster would seemingly drop out of nowhere. The
mixed post must be separated, and the relevant paragraph of this mixed
post should be the first post in the cat thread. This, of course, can
be done -- but not from within hkshell. You could do an "e(123)", and
strip the irrelevant paragraph out of the mostly nuke-oriented post,
but if you now create a new post file, say, x42.post, it will not be
read into the post database. And, if you make the mistake of staying in
hkshell, and do an "e(124)" to change the "Parent" header attribute to
x42, you'll get a nasty exception when attempting to generate HTML
output.

So I think we need either:
- a command to re-read the post database (simple and less foolproof),
- a command to facilitate the splitting of a post.

Such a splitting command could work like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; sp(123)

    (behind the scenes:) vim -O posts/123.post posts/x42.post

This would also spare the editor [1] the burden of keeping track of the
x-numbers.

[1] The person, not the tool.

</span></span>Yes, this feature would be nice, I would have used it, as well. You
can put it onto the todo list, if you want to.

</span></span>I don't understand this.

<pre class="postbody"><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Why would you say e(124)? Why would you get a nasty exception?

</span></span>In this situation, you have a post (123), which contains two topics.
125 is an aswer to the first, the more important, so I'll leave the
"125 is a reply to 123" relationship in place. 124 is the answer to
the "side topic" of 123, so I split the part of 123 which deals with
this into a separate post (x42), and modify 124 (hence e(124)) to
have this new post as its parent.

</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; I don't understand this.

</span></span>Now, when we split a post, we give the new post file an ID, which is
the letter 'x' followed by a number. If one wants to create a new post
file, they have to look at the post directory listing to find the
highest number after the 'x' in post files already present. This
cannot be done from within hkshell as of now. This is one part of the
problem I aim to solve.
