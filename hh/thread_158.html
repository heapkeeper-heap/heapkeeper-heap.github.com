<pre class="post-body-content">Suppose you wrote a post but soon after discover that you missed out
the quotes, forgot to finish a sentence etc. It'd be nice to correct
this in another post so that it'd become right on the Heap, without
any editing. For this, you could add an 'amend' tag. When Hk would
download a post with such a tag, this new post would silently replace
its parent.

Of course we should validate if the senders are the same. Otherwise
misbehaved users could do nasty things to others' posts...

Think this issue is not specific to the "amend". We have to discuss
the conceptual model of running code in posts by Hk at some point. We
talked about it in UMS thread 1176, but we have yet to discuss it
here and make an agreement on it.
