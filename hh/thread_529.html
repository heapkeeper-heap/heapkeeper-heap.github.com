</span></span>I think if it's important (e.g. you warn me about bad style), write an
e-mail, if not, I'll ask why you changed it.

</span></span>I think I will restrict myself from modifying other's commits, unless
necessary. I have a few reasons:

- It may happen very often that I think that other committers made a
  mistake, when they don't, I just don't understand their reasons.
- They may have other things that they want to change after I tell
  them to change something.
- They tested their modifications, so they can retest it easily. I
  don't want to test all commits made by other people. (For example I
  don't want to test the new download feature manually.)

</span></span>These are all about code. You can alter commits though: for example
you can join separate commits that belong together (eg. adf3980 and
e23aa8b (both IMAP), baf5227 and 9c73e08 (both plural)) . You could
use interactive rebase, and mark such commits for "squish". Since the
code itself doesn't change, you can do this without redoing the tests.

</span></span>I have been using this all the time for a few weeks for my own commits :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Since the code itself doesn't change, you can do this without redoing the tests.

</span></span>In this very special case when I squish two commits next to each other
into one, probably it is OK. (Not counting the problem that I have to
make one commit messages from two.)

But if the commits were not parent and child, conflicts would emerge.
Even worse, sometimes there is no conflict, but some intermediate
commits does not work properly. So when I rebased my own commits
(interactively), I executed the tests for all commits:

$ git checkout &lt;head of my working branch&gt;
$ for i in `seq 1 10`; do ./test.py; rm *.pyc; git checkout HEAD^; done

(You have to do either "rm *.pyc" or "sleep 1" after the test, because
otherwise the pyc may not be recompiled, since the timestamp (using
seconds) may be the same. I experienced this problem: the tests failed
at some point in the for-loop, but it turned out that some of the py
files were not recompiled.)

</span></span>In my case, a `hkrc.pyc` remained in place when I had deleted
`hkrc.py`, so the deleting had no effect. This is even more
problematic, as this problem is not avoided by a `sleep 1`.
