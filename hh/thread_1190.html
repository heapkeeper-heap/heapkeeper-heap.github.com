<pre class="post-body-content">I propose removing the Reference attribute of the posts and writing
the same information to the body instead. My arguments:

1. In the _several_heaps branch, showing the post references (=heap
   links) in the body is implemented. The users can write any of this
   into their posts:

<span class="raw-block">        Reference: heap://1

        Original parent of this post: heap://1 (was split because of
        diverging topic)

        Related thread: heap://1, especially heap://5

        Strongly related references:
        - heap://1: long discussion about the same topic
        - heap://5: in-depth review of a similar subject

        Slightly related references:
        - heap://10: slightly related, but funny

   Showing Reference attributes is not implemented in the new
   Generator; so handling the Reference attribute would require
   additional work from us. This not only means spending time once
   to do the programming and testing, but maintaining the additional
   code (some people don't like the idea of Heapkeeper's code being
   large without good reasons ;) )
</span>
2. The "Reference" attribute itself is not always enough, because some
   additional information is needed about why do we refer to the other
   post. Is it the old parent of the current post? Is it just a
   similar thread? What if we want to make a note about the reference?
   I dislike the idea of creating new attributes for these different
   types of references, and I also don't want to have body-like stuff
   in the value of the Reference attribute. As you can see in point 1,
   if all post references are in the body, this is not a problem; the
   users can do with the references whatever they want: add comments,
   meta text, categorize and itemize them, etc.

3. If all references were in the body, we would handle all of them as
   equal, so we would need one `Post.get_refs` function that would
   return all post references in a post. I don't see what we would
   benefit from having two kinds of references, with possibly two or
   three functions (e.g. Post.get_body_refs, Post.get_attr_refs and
   Post.get_all_refs).

4. The Reference attribute should go into the header somehow from the
   body of the email if the author wants to add a reference. This is
   not an issue with having them in the body. (Or would using the
   Reference attribute be the privilege of the maintainers? That would
   not very nice.)

In our heap repository, I already moved References to the body,
because I did not think this proposal to be controversial, but when I
talked to Attis, it turned out that he was not in favor of the idea.

The summary of my arguments:

1. Work with the Reference attribute

<span class="raw-block">    Handling the Reference attribute would be some work to do, and I
    would be glad to get a free ride by moving the references to be
    body.
</span>
2-3-4. Problems with the Reference attribute

<span class="raw-block">    Having all references in the body solves several problems:
    different types of references, notes about references, formatting
    (e.g. itemization and categorization) of references, simple API,
    etc.

<pre class="post-body-content">I already removed the Reference attribute in Heapkeeper v0.5 (commit
5a7e03e573), but I haven't closed this thread because I know Attis has
objections.

I would like to modify my opinion. Now I think that it would be useful
to have an "Original-parent" header attribute. The reason is that with
normal threads, Heapkeeper would be able to determine which quote
belongs to whom. For example if we have the following thread:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Susan: Nice robot

        Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run away!

      &lt;2&gt; Peter: Nice robot

          &gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
          &gt; away!

          Thanks!

        &lt;3&gt; Alfred: Nice robot

            &gt;&gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
            &gt;&gt; away!

            I don't think it is that nice...
</span>
then Heapkeeper would be able to determine that the quote in post 3
originated from post 1. E.g. it could have a feature to add the
author's name before each quote, which could even be a link to the
original post:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;3&gt; Alfred: Nice robot

        [Susan &lt;usr/1&gt;]
        &gt;&gt; Your robot is so nice that I could just take it and run
        &gt;&gt; away!

        I don't think it is that nice...
</span>
This could work until post 2 is marked as the parent of post 3. But
sometimes we break threads because the topic changes significantly
between a parent and a child, and we want the thread view of
Heapkeeper to show them as separate threads. It would be good even in
those cases to provide Heapkeeper with the information that the quotes
in post 3 are originated from post 2.

So now I propose adding an "Original-parent" header attribute. But I
still don't propose having a "Reference" attribute.

</span></span>
I agree.

However, what you are planning would work only if the maintainer of
the heap never adds or removes posts to/from a subthread. A situation
where automatic identification of original authors may be a problem:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Alfred: Chess?

            Anyone for chess tomorrow night?

        &lt;2&gt; Peter: Party tomorrow

                Please don't forget that the annual USR Party will be held
                tomorrow evening.

            &lt;3&gt; Peter: Party tomorrow

                    [note Almost forgot...]

                    &gt; Please don't forget that the annual USR Party will be held
                    &gt; tomorrow evening.

                    Appropriate attire required!

                    [todo join this to parent]

                &lt;4&gt; Susan: Party tomorrow

                        &gt;&gt; Please don't forget that the annual USR Party will be held
                        &gt;&gt; tomorrow evening.

                        Oh, almost forgot.

                        &gt; Appropriate attire required!

                        What do you mean?
</span>
Now if the maintainer obeys what Peter asks in post 3, xe will also
have to modify the quote depth in post 4, otherwise the first quote
will be attributed to Alfred, while the real author is Peter.

To handle this semi-automatically, we should introduce the concept of
a valid quote. A valid n-depth quote contains lines which can be found
in the nth ancestor of the post unquoted. We could check quotes, and
warn if a change introduces new invalid quotes. So, if the maintainer
copies text from post 3 to post 2, nothing happens; but when xe
changes post 4's parent to 2, the first quote in post 4 becomes
invalid.

When maintaining, I never reflow quotes. So, if someone sends a post
like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt; Unnecessary sentence. This is
    &gt; what we really want to
    &gt; quote. This is not needed.

    This is my reply.
</span>
and I want to make the post more readable by decreasing the amount of
quotes, I do this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt; This is
    &gt; what we really want to
    &gt; quote.

    This is my reply.
</span>
If the maintainer does this, deciding if a quote is valid is easy.
Otherwise, we will have to pay attention to whitespace issues.

way, but now you showed me why.

I do reflow quotes because the result will be nicer and more readable.

I think we have a long way to go until we will face with these
problems of quote author detection... So let's remember the points
made in this thread and send this thread to sleep.
