<pre class="postbody">I propose removing the Reference attribute of the posts and writing
the same information to the body instead. My arguments:

1. In the _several_heaps branch, showing the post references (=heap
   links) in the body is implemented. The users can write any of this
   into their posts:

        Reference: <a href="../hh/thread_1.html#post_hh/1">heap://1</a>

        Original parent of this post: <a href="../hh/thread_1.html#post_hh/1">heap://1</a> (was split because of
        diverging topic)

        Related thread: <a href="../hh/thread_1.html#post_hh/1">heap://1</a>, especially <a href="../hh/thread_5.html#post_hh/5">heap://5</a>

        Strongly related references:
        - <a href="../hh/thread_1.html#post_hh/1">heap://1</a>: long discussion about the same topic
        - <a href="../hh/thread_5.html#post_hh/5">heap://5</a>: in-depth review of a similar subject

        Slightly related references:
        - <a href="../hh/thread_10.html#post_hh/10">heap://10</a>: slightly related, but funny

   Showing Reference attributes is not implemented in the new
   Generator; so handling the Reference attribute would require
   additional work from us. This not only means spending time once
   to do the programming and testing, but maintaining the additional
   code (some people don't like the idea of Heapkeeper's code being
   large without good reasons ;) )

2. The "Reference" attribute itself is not always enough, because some
   additional information is needed about why do we refer to the other
   post. Is it the old parent of the current post? Is it just a
   similar thread? What if we want to make a note about the reference?
   I dislike the idea of creating new attributes for these different
   types of references, and I also don't want to have body-like stuff
   in the value of the Reference attribute. As you can see in point 1,
   if all post references are in the body, this is not a problem; the
   users can do with the references whatever they want: add comments,
   meta text, categorize and itemize them, etc.

3. If all references were in the body, we would handle all of them as
   equal, so we would need one `Post.get_refs` function that would
   return all post references in a post. I don't see what we would
   benefit from having two kinds of references, with possibly two or
   three functions (e.g. Post.get_body_refs, Post.get_attr_refs and
   Post.get_all_refs).

4. The Reference attribute should go into the header somehow from the
   body of the email if the author wants to add a reference. This is
   not an issue with having them in the body. (Or would using the
   Reference attribute be the privilege of the maintainers? That would
   not very nice.)

In our heap repository, I already moved References to the body,
because I did not think this proposal to be controversial, but when I
talked to Attis, it turned out that he was not in favor of the idea.

The summary of my arguments:

1. Work with the Reference attribute

    Handling the Reference attribute would be some work to do, and I
    would be glad to get a free ride by moving the references to be
    body.

2-3-4. Problems with the Reference attribute

    Having all references in the body solves several problems:
    different types of references, notes about references, formatting
    (e.g. itemization and categorization) of references, simple API,
    etc.
