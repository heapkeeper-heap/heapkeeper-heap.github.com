<pre class="post-body-content">Previously I argued that all todos should be in our todo file.
I changed my mind: I think we need to document each function
separately and locally whether they have tests and documentation. This
would be especially important for new developers: when they create a
new function, they don't necessarily know their way around the test
suite and documentation.

I propose writing TODO-comments in the code:

<span class="raw-block">    # TODO test, document
    def myfun():
        pass

    # TODO document
    class MyClass:

        # TODO test, document
        def yourfun():
            pass
</span>
If you agree, I will write a small tool that extracts these todos:

<span class="raw-block">    $ scripts/list_todos
    hkrc.py:
        myfun: test, document
        MyClass: test
        MyClass.yourfun: test, document

OK. I like the idea.

How about marking missing stuff only locally, and reserving the TODO
file to emphasize missing and important pieces of test and docs?

Also seems nice.

My proposal was this:
- marking missing documentation and tests locally
- everything else goes into the issue tracker (now todo file, later
  probably a heap)

How is your suggestion different from this? Do you suggest placing
notes about other minor missing things in the source code?

I'm not sure how I feel about that. My problem with that is the
following: in an issue tracking system, these issues can be discussed
easily and it is easy to follow how many issues we have, and to
categorize (tag) them. It is also harder to collect the todos from the
source code if we allow their broader usage. On the other hand, the
context of a note would be easier to grasp if it was placed in the
source code. I also realize that the issue tracking system is more
heavy-weigth than just writing a TODO-comment and developers don't
feel like writing an email about a minor thing they should just do.

We should think about pros and contras of the alternatives.

No, I misunderstood you, then you misunderstood me. I say cluttering
up the source code with all kinds of notes is no good, but one line
per function stating what is missing would be a nice thing. We should
save all else for the TODO file.

On the other hand, it'd be quite senseless to list each and every
missing function documentation and test in the TODO file, since these
are already there in the source code, and anyone can find them, even
automatically. So, for the missing docs and tests, we should only list
the most important ones in the TODO. All other notes and missing
things would, of course, belong there.

<pre class="post-body-content">OK then. We agree (if I didn't misunderstand you :) ) that all todo
should be at exactly one place. If the todo is about missing docs or
test cases, this place is the source code, otherwise it is the todo
file (or later the issue tracker).
