<pre class="post-body-content">"hkshell.p did not work when the argument was a real Post object."

You solved it like this:

<span class="raw-block">    -    return postdb().post(pp)
    +    # PostSet is better in making post from a prepost...
    +    postset = postdb().postset(pp)
    +    return postset.pop()
</span>
I always thought that joke about the mathematician and the teapot was
only a joke :)

`PostSet._to_set` is where the work is done. No surprise here, a loop
and a chain-if:

<span class="raw-block">    for prepost in prepostset:
        # calculating the post for prepost
        if isinstance(prepost, str) or isinstance(prepost, int):
            # prepost is a heapid
            post = postdb.post(prepost, True)
        elif isinstance(prepost, Post): # prepost is a Post
            post = prepost
        elif prepost == None: # prepost is None
            continue
</span>
This of course does the job, but it would have been conceptually
cleaner to have this chain-if in a separate function, and call that
from the loop and `hkshell.p`, too. But this may be a bit faster (one
function call saved), which can matter a lot, since `PostSet` is an
important part of `hklib`'s structure.

I think I know what Russel said about the teapot, but what does that
have to do with this?

No, I meant this:

"Given an empty kettle, running water, a teapot, and a tea bag, how
does a mathematician make tea? He fills the kettle with cold water,
boils the kettle, pours the boiling water into the teapot, adds a tea
bag, waits three-and-a-half minutes, then pours the tea.
Given an kettle full of boiling water, a teapot, and a tea bag, how
does a mathematician make tea? He empties the kettle, thus reducing
the problem to one that has already been solved. QED." [1]

I haven't heard about Russell's teapot, but I'll look it up. [2]

</span></span>
Yes, PostDB.post could have that chain-if. It already has a chain-if
between isinstance(str) and isinstance(int).

BTW, we all know that using isinstance is ugly, so we should keep them
isolated in a very few functions.

&gt; matter a lot, since `PostSet` is an important part of `hklib`'s

We can do measurements :)
