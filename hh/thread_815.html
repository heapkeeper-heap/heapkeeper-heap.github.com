</span></span>Should we write things like this in the commit message? :)

"Have a look at the test cases, they are great!"

Or what did you have in your mind?

I had thought about whether commit messages should mention test cases
and documentation but then I decided that since they should be
written all the time, there is no point in mentioning them. ("Test
cases have been written to test the new feature.") Do you have a
different opinion?

</span></span>I didn't even do that. I just modified the existing test case of
`enew` so that it tests the new arguments.
