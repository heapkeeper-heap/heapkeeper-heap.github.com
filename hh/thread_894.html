<pre class="postbody">There are quite a few ideas I think that we have already written down
and sent to the heap but cannot find them. (I sent a new post about
how to prevent this [1], but the current post is about what to do with
the ones we already have.)

If I find one that is interesting in Hungarian, I will probably send
its main idea to Hh as a new email. If I find one that is in English,
I will probably update its terminology and tag it with Hh. If the
thread is related to our current issues, I may sent a reminder email
to UMS that is a reply to a post in the thread.

</span></span>We decided to add keywords to posts [1]. When we are cleaning up the heap,
we should add keywords to existing posts.

</span></span>OK, but I won't overdo it. I won't add a word to the keywords if it is
present in the text.
