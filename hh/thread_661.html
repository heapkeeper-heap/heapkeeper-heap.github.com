<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; If you have a look at the impact graph [1], you see that we made the
&gt;&gt; same mistakes. We are not shown as two people, but four instead.
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; We sorted this out by rewriting history.
&gt;
&gt; Of course we don't want to do so again, so we should pay attention to
&gt; our identities. (It's much easier now, actually, thanks to the
&gt; constantly moving _-threads.)

</span></span>Maybe we should use more commit hooks. A few days ago I sent a commit
hook that checks that there are no trailing spaces. Other ideas I
have:
- checking that the author and commiter are elements of a predefined
set of authors
- checking that all tests pass

Sometimes when I made a temporary commit, I don't want the tests to be
checked. Probably we should make this a push hook instead of a commit
hook. We could even do "fetch" hooks that would warn us if there is a
problem with the other people's code.

</span></span>Is there any hook that gets invoked when a commit is created via
rebasing? We like to boast that our commits are 100% sure to pass the
tests, but we only tested when we committed first; when they are
rebased, they have a thermodynamical chance of breaking. So I'd like
to be sure.

</span></span>I don't know.

</span></span>We don't execute the tests automatically for commits yet; we should do
that first. But I understand your concern.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; when they are rebased, they have a thermodynamical chance

</span></span>I often do this before pushing:

$ for i in `seq 1 10`; do rm *.pyc; ./test.py; git checkout HEAD^; done

and watch the result.
