<pre class="postbody">I'm happy to announce that pylint [1] can be used for all Heapkeeper
code.

Pylint proved to be useful because it is usually easier to fix an
error that pylint spotted than an error which made a unit test to
fail. The reason is that pylint gives the exact line which contains
the error and why it thinks that there is a problem; the unit test
framework on the other hand gives a stack trace and show how the
assertion failed. Of course pylint will find problems only that can be
found via static checking, and it doesn't seem to do type checking
very well anyway. So pylint and unit tests complement each other well.

Let me get to how pylint can be used with Heapkeeper. Since there are
still some warnings printed by pylint which are not important warnings
to us now, I added a file called "pylintrc" to the Heapkeeper
repository. Pylint will use this file to determine which warnings to
suppress. hk-dev-utils contains a very simple wrapper around pylint
that is easy to use:

    $ hk-dev-utils/hk_pylint

If there are no warnings, this will print nothing. Otherwise it prints
the warnings.

I modified the development policies to be stricter and more
well-defined; now they include for example that pylint should not give
any warnings.

Modifications in development.rst in the _docs branch:

  -Using the version control system
  -^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  -
  -* Run the :ref:`tests &lt;testing&gt;` before you *push* your changes and
never push
  -  code whose test fail.
  -* There is not a strict policy about whether the developers may *commit*
  -  code intentionally that is not correct (e.g. in the middle of a
refactoring).
  -  Probably the best is not commit incorrect code. (Note: it is
about *commit*,
  -  the developers strictly should not *push* code intentionally that is not
  -  correct.)
  -* Try to do larger independent changes in independent commits. E.g.
if you add
  -  50 lines to the documentation and add a new class, and these have
nothing to
  -  do with each other, it is better to have two separate commits for them. Of
  -  course if the documentation is about the new class, it is better
to have them
  -  in the same commit.
  +Policies about commits
  +^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  +
  +The following rules apply to commits in the GitHub repositories. Anyone may
  +have commits in their own private repositories that do not conform to these
  +policies; but before the commits are pushed to GitHub, they should be rebased
  +so that they conform.
  +
  +* All commits should be correct and should contain a version of
Heapkeeper that
  +  works correctly.
  +* Every test case in every commit should pass; i.e. ``test.py``
should execute
  +  all test cases and it should not report any failures. See also :ref:`tests
  +  &lt;testing&gt;`.
  +* :ref:`pylint` should not give any warning in any commit that is
not disabled
  +  in the ``pylintrc`` file of the corresponding commit; i.e.
  +  ``hk-dev-utils/hk_pylint`` should not print anything.
  +* Do independent changes in independent commits, but closely
related changes in
  +  the same commit. As Karl Fogel wrote in his :ref:`book
&lt;reading&gt;`: "have each
  +  commit be a single logical change". You can read more here__. Examples from
  +  Heapkeeper development:
  +
  +  * If you add some documentation and add a new class, and these
have not much
  +    to do with each other, create two separate commits for them.
  +  * If you add a new method to a class, write documentation and
unit tests for
  +    the method, create one commit for all of these. It is nice to review a
  +    commit when both the documentation and the unit tests for the
change are in
  +    the commit.
  +  * If several totally independent source code lines are modified in order to
  +    get rid of :ref:`pylint` warnings, these should be in one
commit. The parts
  +    of the source code that were modified may have nothing to do with each
  +    other, but the commit is still logically a single change
because of the one
  +    common objective.

   See the conventions about commit messages :ref:`here
   &lt;commit_message_conventions&gt;`.

<pre class="postbody">OK.

As a side note: I never imagined pylint would be such a CPU-intensive task!

   $ time ../hk-dev-utils/hk_pylint

   real    0m8.322s
   user    0m8.109s
   sys     0m0.128s

I have a relatively fast machine, and it takes 8 secs at 100% CPU
utilization! The test suite takes only ~280 ms.
