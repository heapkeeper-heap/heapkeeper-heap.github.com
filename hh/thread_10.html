<pre class="post-body-content">Notes:

- I previously suggested using words like 'consequence' and 'direct
  consequence', but I'm not in favour of them any more. The
  tree-analogy (or graph-analogy) is more simple than an analogy using
  causality, and is well-accepted among programmers.

- "primitive" means that it cannot be defined using other concepts
  mentioned here, because they are stored by the post object. Where it
  is not explicitly noted that a concept is primitive, it is not
  primitive. Actually, there are only two primitives: 'parent' and
  'reference'.

- 'See also' does not mean that you can find anything useful there...


Parent (primitive), child:
    Post X and Y can be in a parent-child relation. A post may have
    only one or zero parents, but any number of children. Threads
    are based on parent-child relationships.

<span class="raw-block">    The in-reply-to header of the post object of Y refers to X
    (either by its heapid or messid) iff X is parent of Y. When a
    post is downloaded, it's in-reply-to header will be
    automatically converted to an in-reply-to header of the
    post object, i.e. a parent-reference.

    The code uses 'inreplyto' in many places, but I suggest
    replacing those by 'parent'.

    See also: Post.inreplyto, MailDB.prev, MailDB.children
    (Both the first functions should be renamed to `parent`.)
</span>
Root:
    Every post has a root, which is another post. If a post has no
    parent, it is its own root. Otherwise, the root of the parent is
    the root of the post. We also say that a post is a root if it has
    no parent. So the word 'root' is used both as a relation (X is the
    root of Y) and a plain noun (X is a root).

<span class="raw-block">    See also: MailDB.root
</span>
Thread:
    A thread is a set of mails that have the same root. A thread
    contains exactly one post that has no parent, which is the root of
    the thread. (The third meaning of 'root' :) ) Obviously, the root
    of the thread is a root; and it is the root of all posts in the
    thread. (And it is not a root of any other post.)

<span class="raw-block">    See also: MailDB.threadstruct
</span>
Cycle:
    Each post is in exactly one thread; except for the posts that are
    in a cycle. Those posts are not present in any thread. A post is
    in a cycle if you can go up via the 'parent' relation infinitely
    long and you will never reach a root. The cycles are handled by
    Heapkeeper, but the maintainer of the heap should remove the cycles.

<span class="raw-block">    See also: MailDB.has_cycle, MailDB.cycles
</span>
Reference (primitive):
    A post may refer to any number of other posts. Sometimes if Y is
    a reply to X, the maintainer of the heap decides that X should be
    only a reference in Y instead of being the parent of Y.

<span class="raw-block">    The references of a post are stored in the post object.
</span>
Ancestor:
    If a post has no parent, it has no ancestors. Otherwise the
    ancestors of a post are its parent and the ancestors of its
    parent.

<span class="raw-block">    More informally: the ancestors of a post are its parent, its
    parent's parent, etc.

    See also: PostSet.expb
</span>
Descendant:
    If a post has no children, it has no descendants. Otherwise the
    ancestors of a post are its children and the descendants of its
    children.

<span class="raw-block">    More informally: the descendant of a post are its children, its
    children's children, etc.

    See also: PostSet.expf
</span>
Thread mate:
    (Is this phrase OK, or maybe you can suggest a better one?)

<span class="raw-block">    Two threads are thread mates if they have the same root, i.e. they
    are in the same thread. (Posts in cycles do not have thread
    mates.) The thread mates of a post are the descendants of the root
    of the post and the root itself.

I think a thread should be the set of all descendants of a root (in
the 2nd sense, that is, a post with no parent). What is defined here
would better be called a subthread. (Even if it follows that a thread
is a subthread, and not the other way around.)

True!

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; (in the 2nd sense, that is, a post with no parent). What is defined
&gt; here would better be called a subthread. (Even if it follows that a
&gt; thread is a subthread, and not the other way around.)
</span></span>
How about this:

<span class="raw-block">  **Thread:**
      A thread is the set of a root and all its descendants. A thread
      contains exactly one post that has no parent, which is the root of
      the thread. (The third meaning of 'root' :) ) Obviously, the root
      of the thread is a root; and it is the root of all posts in the
      thread. (And it is not a root of any other post.)

  **Subthread:**
      A subthread is the set of a post and its descendants. That post
      is called the root of the subthread (although it does not have
      to be root in the sense that it may have a parent). A subthread
      may or may not be a thread. A subthread is a thread if and only
      if its root (i.e. the post which together with its descendants
      makes up the subset) is a root (i.e. it has no parent). The root
      of all posts in the subthread is the same. If the subthread is
      not a thread, this root differs from the root of the subthread,
      and it is also the root of other posts outside the subthread.
</span>
We also have to move these definitions below the definition of
"ancestor" and "descendant".

There is a newer version of this glossary in the documentation. You
can find it on the web [1] or on your hard disk [2].
