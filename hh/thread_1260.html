<pre class="postbody">I propose that our posts sent to Heapkeeper Heap should be formatted
so that "normal" text lines are broken at 70 characters. This does not
apply to source code copy-pasted for example from commits.

Quoted text does not have to be reformatted, so first-level quote
lines will have a limit of 72 characters (because they begin with
"&gt; "); second level quote lines will have a limit of 73 characters
(because they begin with "&gt;&gt; "); etc.

72 would be as good as 70, but I have been using 70 so far, and
GMail's web interface uses 70; that's why I propose 70.
