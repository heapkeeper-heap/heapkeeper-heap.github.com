I think it is worth to start to think and talk about how should we
separate them.

== Reorganizing HH heapids ==

Usually it is a very bad idea to modify the heapids of existing posts.
In HH's case, on the other hand, I think it would be rather desirable.
HH's index page otherwise would look weird for new people.

== Heapkeeper support for managing several heaps ==

Hk should have a good support for managing both heaps at the same
time. We want to be able to write commands like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; ums_heap = heap('~/documents/heaps/ums')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hh_heap = heap('~/documents/heaps/hh')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ums = ums_heap.postdb()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hh = hh_heap.postdb()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = ums.post('123')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; p.move(hh)
</span>
Posts can reference to each other, so probably it will not be this
simple. (Or the implementation has to be smart in some way to make it
simple.)

Absolutely.

Do you have any idea for this mass-renaming? We'd have to take care of
any in-body references as well as heapids in In-Reply-To: headers. No
simple task, especially the latter. Maybe we should add a feature for
this to hklib? Then, anyone facing this problem later would have a
readily usable solution.

&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; p.move(hh)
</span></span></span>
Nice examples! Of course, we'd have to take great care when moving,
since heapids are heap-specific, so if a parent message is specified
via its heapid, it will break when moved. Basically the same issue as
with renumbering the split-off heap.

Which is also manageable as long as the format is precisely specified,
as with headers. It is the body that makes me worried.

I think this problem can be solved elegantly only if we make a change
in our model. We take heapids as unique identifiers of posts; from the
moment we have multiple heaps, this is not true.

We have three options:
1. Give a decent support for moving posts between heaps.
2. Give a little support for moving posts between heaps that solves
   our problem with our human help. We may give a decent support at
   some point in the future.
3. Don't give any support, just implement a post-mover function, use
   it and throw it away.

Let's talk about how we could implement a decent support, and if we
decide it would be too hard and we want to separate the two heaps, we
fall back onto the second or third option.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; Hk should have a good support for managing both heaps at the same

&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; ums = ums_heap.postdb()
&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; hh = hh_heap.postdb()
&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; p = ums.post('123')

These comments of yours reveal the two main problems we have.

I'll think about them.

<pre class="post-body-content">In parallel to implementing the "several heaps" feature [1], I
prepared our heap for the separation. I also wrote a small Python
function that performs the separation and placed it in
hkrc_csabahoch.py. I uploaded the page generated from the separated HH
here [2] so that you can check it out. You can also check out how the
post bodies are displayed: the meta text and quotes are highlighted,
and the web and heap references are real links.

We should set up a Google Groups account for HH and send the new
emails there. We should create a GitHub repository for HH and we
should push the new HH posts there, so that will be the primary HH
repository. We should push the HTML pages generated from HH to
heapkeeper.org.

If you say OK, I will try to do these next weekend. If you don't say
anything, I won't do these next weekend, but probably two weeks later.

I decided to use GitHub instead of heapkeeper.org, because
heapkeeper.org has only ftp, which would require us to push each file
all the time. (It seems that there is no good sync-tool for ftp.)
