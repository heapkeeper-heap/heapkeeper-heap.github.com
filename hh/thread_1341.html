<pre class="post-body-content">I'm happy to announce that Heapkeeper v0.7 has been released.

The main improvement of this release are creating a plugin
infrastructure and adding search functionality to hkweb.

Major new features:

- Creating a plugin infrastructure. Three plugins have been created so
  far: the "Review" plugin, which can set posts to reviewed; the
  "Custom Heap Server" plugin, which shows only posts in a specified
  heap; and the "Issue Tracker" plugin, which displays the heap as a
  list of issues.
- Searches can be performed via hkweb.
- When editing a post in hkweb, pressing shift-enter will save the
  post.
- Supporting IMAP without SSL.

Major refactorings:

- Moving the Python source code into the "src" subdirectory and moving
  the CSS/JavaScript/PNG files into the "static" subdirectory.

Other major improvements:

- JavaScript unit tests were added.
- IMAP queries are more efficient and comply with RFC 2683 / 3.2.1.5.
  (Long Command Lines).
