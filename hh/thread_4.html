<pre class="postbody">This heap could also be an experiment to have a bit more wiki-like
heap.

In a wiki, a page consists of a wiki page and a discussion page. The
discussion page is not the strength of the wiki, the threads can be
quite messy. But that's our strength. On the heap, the discussion
would be on a real thread of posts, and the wiki page would be a
pseudo post. The pseudo post would be version controlled together with
the whole heap, and it could have references to the real posts.

Ideas for wiki-like pages:
- Hh conventions
- Glossary about expressions related to using Hh ("Hm", "Hh")
- Glossary about using Hm ("heap", "post", "thread", "index",
  "Heapmanipulator", "heapid"); maybe this should be in the User
  Manual and not here.
- Glossay about developing Hm: maybe this also should be in the User
  Manual rather than in Hh.

If it works, we can think about making it possible to use a heap in a
more wiki-like fashion, with having names for some posts, just like
wiki-pages have names. Or we could embed some kind of wiki syntax into
the posts and have an option to display the formatted text in the post
HTML. But let's see first how the pseudo post system works in the Hh,
which would be the base of the wiki-oriented development.

Until then, what do you say to using wiki-syntax when it seems to be
appropriate? Especially in large posts.

<pre class="postbody">Though you didn't mention the question of syntax directly in your
proposal, I guess from your other posts that you propose to use a
MediaWiki/Wiko-like syntax. But for numbered lists, you used numbers
in your post instead of the #'s demanded by the syntax.

Which leads to the question: do you think we should integrate Wiko
with Heap?

If it is done, #'s will be seen on the Heap as a nice numbered list,
with automatic numbering, which is a nice feature. Downside is that
it's slightly inconvenient when you read the posts as received by
email. Another question: should we start using #'s and similar
Wiko-markup now, or only when the integration is complete (that is, if
we choose to integrate)?

An idea for such an integration which fits together well with your
wiki-heap idea: how about adding a special meta to mark a post as a
wiki, possibly specifying a title, too? If no such meta is present, we
could use the normal body parser, otherwise we would use Wiko to
render the page.

</span></span>Good idea, I'm all for it. This way we don't have to start using
wiki-syntax in our posts, only in some special posts. Those posts
(which will be few in number I think) may be modified later if the
wiki syntax changes. What do you say to using a special tag, e.g.
[wiki-syntax] or [ws]?

[note] Originally a point was made here about when to use tags and when
to use meta text. This was moved to <a href="../hh/thread_21.html#post_hh/21">heap://hh/21</a>.

</span></span>Sometimes I use wiki-like syntax for parts of a post. E.g:

    == First topic ==

    1. something
    2. other thing


    == Second topic ==

    blabla

In this case the wiki syntax should not be processed, it is just for
us, humans. I think this style is easier to read then this style:

    1. First topic
    --------------

    1. something
    2. other thing


    2. Second topic
    ---------------

    blabla

Especially if you consider answering to the post. In the answers we may
create new topics and abandon others. Use numbering for topics,
that would be much more confusing than in the case of using wiki
syntax.

    We should eat pizza.

    == Idea Two ==

    We should drink beer.

        To comment on A's "fantastic" ideas:

        == Idea One ==

        &gt; We should eat pizza.

        In case you haven't realized, it's the middle of the night, so no
        delivery now.

        == Idea Two ==

        &gt; We should drink beer.

        Much better. You still have a chance to find a pub open.

        == Alternative idea ==

        I think we should go to bed.

How about adding some navigational links? Like opening/closing the
Wiki-headings, and adding prev/next links? And maybe a Table of
Contents?

    User A   Subj A [A] &lt;1&gt; 1970.01.01 00:01

This threads-within-threads system is an experimental, underdeveloped
idea, to the point that I'm not even sure if it would be useful at
all. Still I post it, in case someone likes it or has a better idea
based on this.

My intention was to help human reader and help the maintainer if (s)he

that we agree on using this style in the posts; and we will figure out
later how exactly is it useful.

</span></span>I think it would be better for us to use Sphinx instead of Wiko on Hh
(and maybe on UMS Heap as well), because:
- using one system is easier than using two systems,
- it should be easy to move blocks of text between the docs and Hh.

Of course calling the wiki compiler would be a callback function of
Hk, so everybody may use whatever they want.

</span></span>Well, the integration would be a considerable amount of work, because
Sphinx does not handle pure HTML pages, but a document (like Python
documentation) as a whole.

I think we should reduce our wiki engine somehow to a compiler that
compiles a wikifile to HTML. The problem with Sphinx is that I don't
think it is trivial because of the references between pages. E.g. you
can say :class:`MyClass`, but you don't say in which page this class
is. Maybe it is worth to have a look at Wiko again... So the interface
we need is:

    $ wikiengine my.wiki my.HTML
