<pre class="postbody">While cleaning up the heap and fixing a topic branching off a
conversation and gradually turning into a new one, I usually do this:
- `enew()`,
- in Vim, open the original post file in a new window,
- move the new topic to the new post file,
- complete the headers of the new post file,
- save both and exit,
- do a `rl()` since only the new post file is read automatically.

The problem is that doing an `e()` or an `sS()` or many other kinds of
operations marks the thread as "touched", but `rl()` does not. This
means that its thread HTML will not be regenerated.

This is how `rl()` should work:
- load post from file into a temporary post object,
- see if there is a post with the same heapid in the postdb,
- if there is, compare, and if not identical, set as touched,
- if there is no post with the same heapid, set as touched,
- add the post to the postdb (replacing existing one, if any).

I think this is an issue. Do you think this sould be a bug?

</span></span>I made a fix:

<a href="http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/commit/667e17db93e03030d254735eea43820450492ce2">http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/commit/667e17db93e03030d254735eea43820450492ce2</a>

I have tried it out, but not very thoroughly. Does it work for your scenarios?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; This is how `rl()` should work:
&gt; - load post from file into a temporary post object,
&gt; - see if there is a post with the same heapid in the postdb,

&gt; - if there is no post with the same heapid, set as touched,
&gt; - add the post to the postdb (replacing existing one, if any).

</span></span>This is how `rl()` works now:
- see if there is a post with the same post id (former heapid) in the postdb
- if there is no post with the same heapid, read it into a new post
  object and add it to the post database
- if there is, parse it, and compare the parsed header and body to the
  header and the body of the post, and if they are not identical,
  update the header and the body of the post, and set it as touched

The PostDB.load_heap function is a bit more complicated, but the other
stuff does not have to much to do with the post touching.

This fix is on the _0.4 branch, but you can cherry-pick it without
problem on _several_heaps.
