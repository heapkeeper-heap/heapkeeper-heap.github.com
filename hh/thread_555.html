<pre class="post-body-content">We've all seen it happen. In a homogenous thread, a totally different
topic is mentioned through the course of several posts, but mixed with
the "normal" content of the thread. At one point, this new topic gets
recognized, and replied in its own subthread, at which point it can be
safely split off into a new thread easily. But the part where the two
topics are mixed needs strenous manual labor.

An example:

<span class="raw-block">  &lt;101&gt;   Attis   Fallout
    &lt;102&gt;   Csabi   Fallout, nuclear weapons
    &lt;103&gt;   Attis   Fallout, radiation sickness
      &lt;104&gt;   Csabi   Radiation sickness
      &lt;105&gt;   Attis   Radiation sickness, cats
        &lt;106&gt;   Csabi   Radiation sickness, cats
          &lt;107&gt;   Attis   Radiation sickness, cats
            &lt;108&gt;   Csabi   Radiation sickness
            &lt;109&gt;   Csabi   Cats
              &lt;110&gt;   Attis   Cats
                  &lt;111&gt;   Csabi   Cats, rats
</span>
This is how the thread looked when it was downloaded from IMAP. The
obvious first move would be to split &lt;109&gt; off (i.e. changing its
"Parent:" header line to "Reference:" once it's implemented, now make
it into a "reference" meta). But the alternative topic is still there
in posts 105 to 107!

Now an imaginary procedure follows, which I think would be the best
(= most comfortable) solution to this problem.

You enter this in Hkshell:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; split(105, 107, 'cats', 'x')
</span>
Now nasty voodoo magic happens inside Hk, and the user gets a Vim
window like this (keep in mind, this is not final, only an artist's
concept of what it could look like):

Now the user can view each message, and, for each one, move the lines
dealing with the alternative topic into the right-hand side window.
The "cats" line acts as a boilerplate or reminder to the user about
the topic of the newly-created thread (to prevent confusion of the old
and new thread's topic).

The new thread's filenames (and heapids) are formed by taking the
prefix given as the 4th parameter, and finding the next free number
available. We've discussed the advantages of this feature before.

By default, the split thread shares the same parent as the original.
If the user doesn't want this, as in this case, all they have to do is
change the first new post's "Parent:" line to "References:" (or now to
a "reference" meta).

What we need to have this working:
- mechanism to track the subthread specified
- Vim sorcery to throw up this complicated window setup
- mechanism to find the next free filename

Other than that, this command would be similar to `e()`, i.e. it
should reload the affected posts from the disk once the editor has
exited.

Do you mean expanding (105,107) to [105,106,107]?

I once described that PostDB.expf() and PostDB.exp() should have an
optional "stop" argument. (It's not implemented yet.) The following
example expands the post set that contains only post 105, but it stops
when it reaches 108:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; ps(105).expf(stop=[108])
</span>
Generally, `stop` could be any post set.

Currently there is a not so difficult workaround:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; ps(105).expf() - ps(108).expf()

</span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - Vim sorcery to throw up this complicated window setup
</span></span>
This will be a joy to do :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - mechanism to find the next free filename
</span></span>
Piece of cake.

I have already done something like this, but I haven't pushed it yet.
I think we should have a hkshell option 'post_id_prefix' that stores
the prefix to be used. It would be "attis_" for you and "csabi_" for
me, set in our hkrc files.

Yes.

Yes, I remember this discussion. [1]

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Generally, `stop` could be any post set.
&gt;
&gt; Currently there is a not so difficult workaround:
&gt;
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1"><span class="raw-block">&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; ps(105).expf() - ps(108).expf()
</span></span></span>
This does not do what we want. Suppose the thread looks like this:


<span class="raw-block">   &lt;105&gt;
     &lt;106&gt;
       &lt;107&gt;
         &lt;108&gt;
         &lt;109&gt;
           &lt;110&gt;
               &lt;111&gt;
     &lt;112&gt;
   &lt;113&gt;
     &lt;114&gt;
</span>
In this case, you could select "105..107" only as:

<span class="raw-block">    ps(105).expf() - ps(108).expf() - ps(112) - ps(113).expf()
</span>
My solution:

<span class="raw-block">    def straight(start, end):
        now = p(end)
        while True:
            yield now
            now = postdb().parent(now)
            if now == p(start):
                yield now
                break
</span>
This generates a straight line, so you don't have to care about
branches.

I think mixed topic problems typically occur along a straight line; if
someone answers a post that already has one child, they won't answer
mixed topics, they typically have something to say about one of the
topics. This observation is presented without proof or explanation, it
is merely my impression based on tidying the UMS Heap. And believe me,
it has been a mess in the first few hundred posts... :)

OK.

This would be a job for expb then:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; ps(107).expb(stop_with=[105])
</span>
`stop_with` would mean "stop at these post, but include them in the
result".
