<pre class="post-body-content">Have you installed Sphinx? A bug was corrected in it a few days
ago, which is important to me, so I'd like to use the newest Sphinx
version (got from their Mercurial repository). The current official
release won't be able to compile the Heapkeeper documentation, if we
agree on using the new, fixed version (which is not an official
release yet). So if you want to use Sphinx, get a Mercurial and then
get Sphinx.

I think soon there will be Sphinx 1.0, but there may be other times
when we want a more fresh version. On the other hand, I don't want to
say everybody "use the latest version from the Sphinx repository",
because that may have new bugs (as happens to Heapkeeper sometimes after a
new commit...) Maybe I even want to improve Sphinx a but, who knows :)

Sphinx is hosted by bitbucket [1], which is just like GitHub, but it
uses Mercurial. A simple solution would be to state that "Heapkeeper
uses the X revision of Sphinx that can be downloaded from the Sphinx
repo". If there is a bugfix or a feature important to us in Sphinx, we
would recommend using a newer revision.

Sphinx has 11 forks there (fork means of course that the original
project call pull from them). Another elegant solution to our problem
is to create another fork and state that Heapkeeper always uses our
fork of Sphinx. That would allow me to hack Sphinx :) But until I get
serious about this, I propose to use my first solution.

</span></span>
The bug is described in this thread [1]. Essentially it is the
following. There is a macro-like facility in Sphinx which allows
defining shorthands:

<span class="raw-block">    .. |Hk| rename:: Heapkeeper

    |Hk| is a nice tool. I love |Hk|.
</span>
It will be "precompiled to":

<span class="raw-block">    Heapkeeper is a nice tool. I love Heapkeeper.
</span>
The problem is that it did work for plain text, but did not for other
text objects like classes. So I could not write this:

<span class="raw-block">    .. |Post| rename:: :class:`Post &lt;hklib.Post&gt;`
</span>
Which is very useful, since we have a lot of text like this:

<span class="raw-block">    A :class:`Post &lt;hklib.Post&gt;` object represents a post.
    :class:`Post &lt;hklib.Post&gt;` is a very nice class.
</span>
Which could be written just like this:

<span class="raw-block">    A |Post| object represents a post. |Post| is a very nice class.
</span>
Fortunately the newest version fixes the bug, so I started writing
stuff like this in the documentation. (See the beginning of
hkshell.rst and the docstrings in hkshell.py).

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; What makes our current docs incompatible with the official release?
</span></span>
The bugfix is not present in the official release of Sphinx yet.

But don't worry - it turned out that installing Sphinx from the
Mercurial repository is easier than installing from an official
version stored in a zip file.

We decided to use a repository version of Sphinx and to specify that
version on the Hk homepage.
