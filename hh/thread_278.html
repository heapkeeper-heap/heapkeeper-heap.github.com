</span></span>I don't know what an admin does exactly on Wikipedia.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Would you expand this idea?

</span></span>This two-cast system was just my perception about your idea. You
said:

    On the Hungarian Wikipedia, a new revision patrolling system has
    been instantiated. This is pretty similar to how I fancy using a
    Git repo as a backend for the Web interface.

I guess many maintainer would be allowed commit their changes into the
local repository, but only the upper cast could push them e.g. to the
repository on GitHub. I don't fancy this idea very much, the heap
would lose its dynamics in my opinion. It also would not make too much
sense, since if we have a git repository on Hkweb, we don't need
GitHub at all.

Another (more sensible) two-cast system is to have many maintainer who
are allowed to change the posts via the web interface, but only a
limited number of people who are allowed to work via hkshell.

</span></span>There is a problem with this. If an upper-caste maintainer would reject
a commit made by a lower-caste maintainer, the process of removing the
commit before the push would be nontrivial.

I thought the outer party would make the changes, and the inner party
would commit them. That, of course causes synchronization problems once
the heap has a decent amount of traffic.

</span></span>Don't really feel like... hope you can understand :)

I think we will have to introduce some kind of lockout system anyway. My
idea would be to lock the database for the time of creating a complete copy --
a snapshot. Then, if it's complete, editing can resume, and the copy would be
committed into the repository.

This approach only makes sense if creating a full copy is much faster than
committing into git right away, which I doubt.

A more sophisticated approach would be to keep changes in memory for the time
of a database freeze, and when the freeze is over (ie. the commit has
completed), the changes would be transferred from memory to disk.

</span></span>Me neither; that's why I wrote ellipses at the end of the sentence.

</span></span>I don't really understand what is the use of the copy. Different posts
are edited by different people at the same time; what does "resume"
mean in this context? Deleting the work of everyone since the last
commit? (Read my last paragraph before answering.)

</span></span>Are you talking about dealing with synchronization problems or
the implementation of the don't-commit-until-approved feature?
(Also: read my last paragraph before answering.)

I have a feeling that we are on the wrong track. I'm happy with the
git repository containing everything everybody ever posted -- just not
on GitHub. If someone is not happy with that, they are free to use
some other VCS instead of git, which allows them to remove certain
commits even from their history. Maybe we too should use something
else that fits our needs better.

Plus, if we want to do a commit, we'd have to temporarily lock the web
interface.

And, yet another point: current hkshell can't accomodate more than one users
editing the heap at the same time. This minor inconvenience would turn into a
huge problem with hkweb.

</span></span>That is exactly what it would solve: being able to perform complex
operations that require hkshell without having to grant full access to
a heap server to everybody who wants to be an editor.

</span></span>I'm not sure about this. We do need synchronization between commits of
course.

</span></span>Yes, I have thought about this before. It should be the topic of
another thread though.
