<pre class="postbody">I have to admit that I dislike the current web design of Heapkeeper's
HTML output. I think I hurt nobody will take this as an offense, as it
was me who designed our current CSS. However, I am partially color blind
[1], which severely limits my abilities as a web designer. I'm sorry.

I think I designed the color scheme using Agave (which is a great tool
for people who are not very good with colors), and my vision was a desert
sunset. (Rationale: I am fed up with blue as it is overused in visual
designs, and I wanted simple and unobtrusive design.)

But I screwed up. The current design is not only unobtrusive, but rather
dull; and, what hurts more, there are serious legibility issues. The
gray of the post ID's is not well readable, and the index and section
headers also fail to guide your attention.

As I lack the skill to do it right, I'll have to steal an existing design. I
love green. And also love and use Vim. Vim's home page has a green-based
design. What a coincidence, how about modeling our design after it?

It's simple, but powerful, and we love it. (At least I do.)

Besides, have you ever examined that site closely? Not a single div, it's all
tables. Of course, Vim is all about sticking with the good things that have
stood the test of time :)

Besides, there is a repository of many open-source designs [2]. Most of those
are provided on an attribution-mandatory license, but that's OK with us. (Of
course we'd give credit to Bram if we decide to use his site as a template.)

</span></span>You can have a look at the Vim colors at :h group-name.

</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;

</span></span>That's not stealing, I think. We can mention somewhere in the doc
though where we got the colors from.
