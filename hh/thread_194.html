Very nice job! It would have taken some Googling and documentation
reading for me to figure out os.stat.

</span></span>I wanted to quote Eric S. Raymond here [1] (this quote was also
acknowledged by Producing Open Source Software):

    Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
    personal itch.

Here, you were very fast to implement this feature probably because it
scratched your itch :)

</span></span>Of course I googled and RTFM'd too... Heck, I can't even calculate the
average and SD of numbers read from stdin without Google &amp; docs. And I
have to admit it makes me feel awful.

</span></span>Yes, mostly. But of course you must be acknowledged for creating that
dummy method, it made my work very simple.
