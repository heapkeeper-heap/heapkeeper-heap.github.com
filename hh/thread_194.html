Very nice job! It would have taken some Googling and documentation
reading for me to figure out os.stat.

Here, you were very fast to implement this feature probably because it
scratched your itch :)

Of course I googled and RTFM'd too... Heck, I can't even calculate the
average and SD of numbers read from stdin without Google &amp; docs. And I
have to admit it makes me feel awful.

Yes, mostly. But of course you must be acknowledged for creating that
dummy method, it made my work very simple.
