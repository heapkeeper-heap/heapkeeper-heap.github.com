== Link on the index page to the search page ==

Heapkeeper has a Google-like search page that contains almost only a
search bar (localhost:8080/search). Csabi will place the search bar on
the top of the hkweb index page, which Attis likes too. Csabi also
wanted to put a link to the search page onto the index page so that
the search page will not be a hidden feature. He saw two alternatives:

a) Putting the link next to the search bar:

<span class="raw-block">    [input form] [Search button] [Link to search page]
</span>
b) Creating a new section after the search bar for links like the
   search page, Heapkeeper homepage, later a help page etc. Specific
   heaps could extend this list, e.g. HH could link to its issue
   tracker page (that does not exist yet).

Attis's opinion on option "b" was that a customizable section would be
useful where one can put e.g. useful links, but he did not really
understand the purpose of the separate search page. Csabi said that
the separate page would be useful because it would load much faster
then the index page. Attis said that the solution to this would be to
have the index page show only the n newest threads. Csabi accepted
this solution.

We agreed that in the short term, we would add a link section to the
current page, which would not include the search page. Later we would
show only the newest threads on the index page, and would have a link
for the whole post database (which is the current index page).

Csabi mentioned that the "n newest threads" is not as trivial as it
sounds, because the "newest thread" in Heapkeeper means "the one with
the newest root", and the index page should not display the n newest
threads in this sense; but it should display n threads that contain
the newest posts.
