<pre class="post-body-content">I had a problem with the diamond inheritance [1] in Python, and the
way to solve it was to introduce init() methods next to __init__()
methods. I applied this solution only to the generator classes,
because I don't expect to use diamond inheritance with other classes.

== The problem ==

The problem is the following. Consider this inheritance structure:

<span class="raw-block">    class A(object):

        def __init__(self):
            print 'A initialization'

    class B(A):

        def __init__(self):
            A.__init__(self)
            print 'B initialization'

    class C(A):

        def __init__(self):
            A.__init__(self)
            print 'C initialization'

    class D(B, C):

        def __init__(self):
            B.__init__(self)
            C.__init__(self)

    D()
</span>
The problem is that the __init__ method of A will be called twice. The
output of the program above is this:

<span class="raw-block">    A initialization
    B initialization
    A initialization
    C initialization
</span>
This is usually not what we want, because D will have only one A
instance inside: it will have only one of each data member of A. We
want to see this:

<span class="raw-block">    A initialization
    B initialization
    C initialization
</span>
It is usually recommended to use super() instead of just A.__init__,
but that will not help me, it will only be more implicit and even more
confusing, so I will not use it.

== The solution ==

I haven't found any proper solution to this on the Internet, so I
invented my own. The idea is to separate the two parts of the __init__
method:

1. Calling the __init__ methods of base classes.
2. Performing initialization, e.g. setting the values of data members.

The second part shall be extracted to a separate function called init,
so that it can be invoked by subclasses without invoking the
initialization methods of the base classes.

My example would look like this:

<span class="raw-block">    class A(object):

        def __init__(self):
            A.init(self)

        def init(self):
            print 'A initialization'

    class B(A):

        def __init__(self):
            A.__init__(self)
            B.init(self)

        def init(self):
            print 'B initialization'

    class C(A):

        def __init__(self):
            A.__init__(self)
            C.init(self)

        def init(self):
            print 'C initialization'

    class D(B, C):

        def __init__(self):
            A.__init__(self)
            B.init(self)
            C.init(self)
            D.init(self)

        def init(self):
            pass

    D()
</span>
Now the output is the desired one:

<span class="raw-block">    A initialization
    B initialization
    C initialization
</span>
So the logic is that if you write a class that has one or more base
classes, but without diamond inheritance, you just have to call the
__init__ methods of the base classes after each other as usual and
call your own init() method at the end to do the initialization of
this class.

The thinking comes in when a class has multiple base classes with
diamond inheritance. In this case, the author of the class has to
think about what base classes should be initialized and in what order.
Here, the author of class D saw that first A can be initialized
together with all its base classes, so the author first called
A.__init__. This left B, C and D to be initialized, which was done by
calling each of their init() methods.

It is important to call &lt;Class&gt;.init(self) instead of self.init()
everywhere. E.g. if A.__init__ would call self.init() instead of
A.init(self), then this line would invoke D.init() in a D instance
instead of A.init(), which is not what we want.

== Conclusion ==

I started to use this technique in Heapkeeper.

I'm wondering whether you have ideas about how acceptable this
technique is and/or how could it be improved.
