<pre class="post-body-content">I have managed to review all posts in Heapkeeper Heap.

There are a few things that could be improved though:
- I haven't cleaned up all post syntax threads. The biggest beast is
  <a href="../hh/thread_156.html#post-summary-hh-156">heap://hh/156</a> (Body parsing - the what). I think I will wait with that until
  hkweb has even more features that may be helpful in cleaning up these threads.
- I haven't examined the tags we use. They should be more standardized.
- I haven't made all posts contain diffs and commit identifiers according to
  a certain convention.
