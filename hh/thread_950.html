<pre class="postbody">In case of the new Generator, I hope it's not the customizable/flexible
architecture that will prove to be the bottleneck. That we can do some caching
and regenerate e.g. only the affected part of the index page after modifying
some posts. Currently regenerating the index is the bottleneck in my hh
maintaining/tidying workflow.

In case of initialization and post parsing, I don't know where to expect the
bottleneck, I'm not sure it can be done significantly faster within Python.
Maybe if we use loops instead of regexp, but I'm not even sure that would help,
since the regexp engine is written in C, which can be faster then our Python
loops. The one thing that I'm sure could help a lot is to rewrite the parser
(hklib.Post.parse_header, currently 14 lines of Python code) in C. Maybe even
the create_header function is a good idea to rewrite.

</span></span>I think we should do a "null parser" that reads (ie. iterates once)
over all the post files, and does nothing but emits the same post
object for all the post files. This would give us a lower bound for
the optimization, a reference value we know we can't get better.

If this is still not fast enough to scale up to much larger post
counts, then some serious thinking will be needed.
