<pre class="post-body-content">== Hk as editable mailing list ==

So far we agreed that Hk is an "editable mailing list" or "editable
mailing list archive". This seems to be a genuinely new idea.

Google results (all written between in quotes):
- "editable mailing list" -&gt; 4 results
- "editable mailing archive" -&gt; 0 result
- "editable mail archive" -&gt; 0 result

== Hk as distributed mailing list archive ==

=== The word "archive" ===

I know "archive" is not the best word here. "Distributed mailing list"
in itself has a different meaning, that's why I'm hesitant to use that
here [1].

<span class="raw-block">    "Cypherpunks is a distributed mailing list. A subscriber can
    subscribe to one node of the list and thereby participate on the
    full list. Each node (called a Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer
    [CDR], although they are not related to anonymous remailers)
    exchanges messages with the other nodes in addition to sending
    messages to its subscribers. A message posted to one node will be
    received by the list subscribers on the other nodes, and
    vice-versa."
</span>
=== Motivation ===

There is a big hype nowadays around "distributed" management tools [2].
Distributed version control is widely used, and I sent an email a few
days ago about distributed issue tracking.

Shouldn't we be the "distributed mailing list archive"? (DMLA for
short.)

=== Example ===

Here I will talk about HH, but it could be any heap; anyone could have
the same goals that we have when we want to use HH for issue tracking
Hk.

So I was thinking about using Hk as its own issue tracker. The obvious
advantage would be that if someone files an issue, it means that xe
sends an email to HH with a special meta note (e.g. [issue]).

But then I was editing our Todo file. I realized that a lot of times
I want to add small issues and I don't want to write one-line emails
about each single one. I want to store the new issues _within Hk_,
without having to have for example Internet access.

In these cases we just create a new post on the heap. There is no
command that does that yet, but soon there will be:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; enew()
    # Hk creates a new post with a new heapid.
    # The user edits the post in a text editor.
    # The user closes the editor.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s()
</span>
The problem is people won't get emails about posts that were created
this way. I see two solutions. The first is the better one.

==== Sending email with Hk ===

We should have commands that sends emails from within Hk!

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_email()
    # Hk creates a new post with a new heapid.
    # The user edits the post in a text editor.
    # The user closes the editor.
    # Hk emails the post to the list.
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</span>
Or course we could have a mechanism for not sending the emails
rightaway, but storing them:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; set('email.store')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_email()
    # Hk creates a new post with a new heapid.
    # The user edits the post in a text editor.
    # The user closes the editor.
    # Hk will remember the post as an email to be sent.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_email()
    # Creating another email
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list_emails()
    [&lt;post '123'&gt;, &lt;post '124'&gt;]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; send_emails()
    # Sending emails
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list_emails()
    []
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</span>
Of course we could have shorter names (nE for "new email", lE for
"list email", sE for "send email").

===== Avoiding heapid clash =====

In order to avoid the situation where more people gets the same new
heapid for their emails, the name of the author should be present in
the posts' heapid:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_email()
    # ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list_emails()
    [&lt;post 'csabi_3'&gt;]
</span>
===== What should happen when someone commits unsent emails? =====

Everybody should send only emails written by xem. The send_emails command
would send only the posts that has the same author as the user of the
program. (Now Hk does not know who is the user of the program. This
feature would require Hk to know that. It is not a big deal, hk.cfg
could contain that information.)

==== Commit emails ====

This section is an alternative solution to the the problem that people
don't get emails about posts that were created with Hk with the
current Hk.

The HH repository could have commit emails that are sent to everyone
on the mailing list. (Commit emails=automatic emails about commits.)
This way, when the new posts are committed to the central HH repo,
people would get emails.

The problem is that emails which are sent normally would be committed
afterwards, so they would be received twice. (Once as normal emails
and once as post commits.) This could be worked around by setting up
the commit email system in a way that it does not send emails about
commits with the log message "New mail downloaded". But I think this
is not convenient for most people on the mailing list, who don't care
about all changes in the posts and don't want to go through the commit
emails.

Another, even worse problem is that people won't be able to "reply" in
their email client to posts created this way.

The problem of sending emails from within Hk is still unresolved.
