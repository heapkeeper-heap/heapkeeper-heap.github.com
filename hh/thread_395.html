<pre class="postbody">We have a problem with running Hk on Python 2.6. Python 2.6 which handles the
-i option differently from 2.5. In 2.6, If you start hkshell in a way that it
wants to quit right after performing its task, you will see an exception:

    $ ./hkshell --version
    Heapkeeper version 0.3uc
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "hkshell.py", line 1369, in &lt;module&gt;
        sys.exit(0)
    SystemExit: 0
    &gt;&gt;&gt;

The reason is that hkshell invokes "python -i hkshell.py", which used to quit
silently after hkshell.py called sys.exit(), up until Python 2.5. But in Python
2.6, the philosophy seems to be that if you type "-i", you want to inspect what
happened in the program, so you don't want to quit from the Python interpreter.

We should solve this problem at least temporarily before releasing Hk 0.3. It
was quite difficult to make everything work even in 2.5. Now we have one option
less. Maybe we should change direction; this is clearly not the way Python is
supposed to be used. I will think about this.

</span></span>Problem solved in commit 0adaf99477 (2009-17-19) with using
"code.interact" instead of "python -i".

But from now on, we should do additional tests on Python 2.5, since
normally I use 2.6. What do you use? (And we should also test on
Windows, as you pointed out.)
