I see you have some concerns about our workflow. You've also voiced
these doubts at the VigConf. I would love to hear the specifics, maybe
we can find an easy answer, or, if not, at least we'll know better
what we're looking for.

I don't think that the original idea of pushing our branches to the
point where we are with the reviewing process would be flawed. It
would and should work -- only if we could devote more time to the
project.

So, maybe what we are looking for is a more "lazyness-tolerant" workflow?

I don't think that either.

</span></span>
Yes, probably. It should support the use case when only one of us work
and the other just reads email and has little time for the project.
(Which is only temporary of course.)

Other O/S projects have some kind of timeout (if noone objects in a
week, it will be considered as agreed). Sometimes I think that it a
good idea. What do you think?

It seems that this method requires us to do more review than we can
handle. Maybe we would have shorter (and of course not so thorough)
reviews to make sure that coding goes on and the master branch will
not be left behind.

I honestly don't know what to do with code reviews! I hate it. It is
so much harder to review code that to write it. Or maybe it is not
hard, but it is definitely not as rewarding. Any ideas on how to make
reviewing more rewarding?

I don't know about you, but I have to admit, I am lost in our commits.
We have quite a few branches, and we are not good at keeping track of
the state of the commits. Now for example we have a linear tree of a
few segments; the first segment has been review by both of us, the
second waits for you, the third waits for me etc. We don't have a good
way for describing our state. If I put Gitk and the wave next to each
other, I still have a very hard time finding out where we are, and
which commits belong to a segment. And I'm the author of most
commits...

If I decide to rebase something, I can't do it without effecting you.
That's OK, but we should have a place where I describe what I did, so
that when you start your work, you can catch up, destroy the necessary
branches etc. This would be an informal git log: it would log the
reality and not the rewritten reality. It would be nice if you could
mark the log entries as "read" or "done". It should be a linear list
of changes, maybe with some comments intervened.

You have not answered to my question on dec 1 on the Branches wave.
(Note: I'm not here to blame you.) If we don't want to be slow (I
don't), we should either be more responsive, or be able to make
decisions like this on our own. I have not been very responsive either
in the last few weeks, so I think we should go for the second option.

Our master branch is so far behind; we should fast forward it more
often. It is an important factor because the chaos is always *after*
the master; so if we have half as commit after the master, the
chaos in the new branches is half as big. Also, the relevant part is
the "reality log" would be smaller, and the "branch state" page would
also be half as big.

I think these are the biggest problems, and that's what I think
we could do about it:
1. Find a better way to describe the state of the tree. Either inside
   our outside of Wave, I don't know. The goal is to be very tidy, and
   maybe Wave does not force us to have a discipline.
2. Let's have a reality log. Maybe Wave, maybe not.
3. Have a one week timeout for proposals. I.e. if there is no
   discussion nor agreement for one week, the proposer can go ahead.
4. Let's fast forward the master branch more often.

An intriguing idea. How would you implement it?

Don't you think the need for such a "reality log" means that we should
give up our rebasing workflow?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; You have not answered to my question on dec 1 on the Branches wave.
</span></span>
It is hard to take up a new habit. E-mail is now a strong habit: when
I sit down to a computer, one of the first things I do is check
e-mail [1]. Wave has not made itself such a habit.

Maybe the way to handle the topics we used to discuss on the Wave
would be best handled by a new heap. This could serve as a kind of
bulletin board where we could post our plans, a summary of our daily
work etc. What do you think?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; (Note: I'm not here to blame you.) If we don't want to be slow (I
&gt; don't), we should either be more responsive, or be able to make

&gt; in the last few weeks, so I think we should go for the second option.
</span></span>
We've been doing this for one or two months now. I think it works: you
do most of the development, while I'm trying to follow you, and from
time to time, I contribute something useful to the code. What do you
think?

I love `gitk`. And in git, tags are cheap. How about having tags like
"waiting-for-attis-review-start" and "waiting-for-attis-review-end"?
OK, sounds wild, but I think we should give it a try.

</span></span>
Reality log... I just don't know. Git does this, in a sense. It keeps
two timestamps for the commit and the code. When we rebase, only the
commit timestamp changes. Maybe a "reality log" is only a matter of
sorting commits by code timestamps?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; 3. Have a one week timeout for proposals. I.e. if there is no

Maybe we should. I have described a method we could use in another thread [1].

Wave is nice because the messaging can become instant dynamically. But
we can try out your suggestion.

I dislike the idea of using tags for this purpose. Tags are very
official things: they show up in the download page on github [2], and
tags are not meant to be deleted (I think they are harder to delete
than branches.)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; 2. Let's have a reality log. Maybe Wave, maybe not.
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;

</span></span>
The reality log is mainly about the reasons of why something was
rebased. It is not about storing dates, it is about how and why branch
X got modified. It is mainly for developers who want to understand why
a remote branch disappeared or got rebased, and what is the difference
between the old and the new version of the branch.

If we have a new heap that you proposed, we may have a special tag for
reality log. These posts would explain how and why certain rebases
happened.

I think that it works, too. The proposal was about having this timeout
without explicit mention. What do you think about that?

Like an IM conversation about what we are rebasing. But it does not
have to be real time, thanks to wave.

Just imagine that there is an IRC room where we only talk about
rewriting git history. The log of that room would be the reality log.
Nothing formal.

<pre class="post-body-content">It depends on how much do we rewrite history (which is allowed in
usual topic branches whose names start with underscore). Probably we
won't do too many rewrites, so the reality log is not that important.

Is it OK if the timeout is one week? Or would you prefer another time span?

Let's say that the implicit timeout is always one week, and if a
proposal needs a shorter timeout, it would have to be explicitly
specified.

Do your statements ("We've been doing this for one or two months now",
"from time to time, I contribute something useful to the code") imply
that you contributed to the code in the last two months? :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; What do you think?
</span></span>
I think this workflow you describe is OK.

I'd like to point out something here. I don't want either of us being
active to cause that the other not be able to spend enough time
writing code. For example, it is OK if developers spend half or
quarter of their time on communication, tenth of their time reviewing
others' code, and the rest developing new code. What I don't want is
the following: if I have more time to write code and emails, and you
want to review all code and answer all emails thinking about them
carefully, you may not have enough time to write code yourself. It is
a downward spiral, because I will be more and more productive because
I get better and better writing at code, and I don't even have to
spend my time reviewing others' code, because there will not be code
from others for me to review. So I'd rather see you reading through
the commit messages quickly without even looking at the code, and
answering my emails only if it is quick or you think it is important.
This way you can spend a large amount of your "Heapkeeper time"
actually writing code (and testing and documenting it :) ), which
makes you more comfortable with the code base and the workflow, which
in turn makes you be able to make more thorough reviews and write more
thoughtful emails.

Maybe, but unfortunately this is not true; in these two months, I haven't
found the time to contribute. But it looks like that in the near future,
I will. And during my absence, things haven't stopped: and that's the
most important merit of this workflow.

I like this thought a lot. It helps me understand how I have dropped
behind so much. And the advices were much needed. So, from now on,
should I ever run low on time, I'll prefer reading commit messages to
trying to read and answer all emails. Hopefully, that'll allow me to
keep up with the development better.
