<pre class="post-body-content">I faced an interesting problem today. My finding is the following:

<span class="raw-block">    In Python, you can't execute "import" statements in two different
    threads at once.
</span>
This means that if you use `import x` in a thread, then you cannot do
any import in any other thread until the import of x module is
complete. I learnt this by debugging a deadlock for an hour.

== My story ==

The story is the following: my hkrc calls `hkweb.start()`, which
creates another thread for the webserver. I modified hkweb.start and
the webserver to be synchronous when the former calls the latter,
which means that hkweb.start would finish only when the webserver has
been started. (Without this, the automatic test sometimes failed; it
failed when the main thread (which executes the tests) made the http
request before the server thread got to actually starting the server.)
I used a simple lock for the implementation. (Simple means it does not
know anything about threads; any thread can acquire or release it.
"Acquire" and "release" are not the best words for what I use them,
but never mind. The main thing is that a lock can be acquired only if
it is in a "released" state, and the "acquire" method puts it into an
"acquired" state.) This is how it is supposed to work: hkweb.start
acquires the lock, starts the webserver thread, and tries to acquire
it again. That second acquisition will succeed only when the webserver
has been started, because the webserver is the one who releases the
lock so that it can be acquired again. After hkweb.start acquires the
lock, it releases it and returns; but at this point, we are sure that
the web server is started and the main thread can send a request to
it.

The problem was that hkshell imported my hkrc, who (during the
execution of this import statement) called `hkweb.start`, who started
the webserver thread, and waited for the lock to be released by the
webserver. The webserver thread started to initialize the webserver,
invoked an import statement to import some module... and hanged,
because the main thread was in the middle of importing a module (my
hkrc), so it had to wait for that to finish. This way the system got
into a deadlock.

== Proposal ==

I propose that hkrc modules should have a start() function which will
be called automatically by hkshell, and everything other than
function/class/variable definitions and trivial calls should be done
there.

== An example to reproduce the problem ==

If someone wants to reproduce this problem, here is a way to do so.

o.py: (this models hkshell)

<span class="raw-block">    print 'Importing p...'
    import p
    print 'Importing p... [done]'
</span>
p.py: (this models my hkrc)

<span class="raw-block">    print 'Importing r...'
    import r
    print 'Importing r... [done]'

    print 'p: calling r.start()...'
    r.start()
    print 'p: calling r.start()... [done]'
</span>
r.py: (this models hkweb)

<span class="raw-block">    import threading

    class MyThread(threading.Thread):

        def __init__(self):
            super(MyThread, self).__init__()

        def run(self):

            print 'Importing parser...'
            import parser
            print 'Importing parser... [done]'
            lock.release()

    def start():
        lock = threading.Lock()
        lock.acquire()
        mythread = MyThread()
        mythread.start()
        lock.acquire()
        lock.release()
</span>
If you start o.py, this is the output before it reaches the deadlock:

<span class="raw-block">    $ python o.py
    Importing p...
    Importing r...
    Importing r... [done]
    p: calling r.start()...
    Importing parser...
