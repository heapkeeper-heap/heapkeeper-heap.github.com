they are different functions with different names :) )
PostDB.walk_thread walks over a given thread and yields non-flat post
items. PostDB.walk_cycle walks over the posts in cycles and yields
flat post items. Do you expect that they share more common feature?

</span></span>How about having one common `walk_postset` with having flat or
non-flat as a parameter? The only difference in the current
implementation is augmentation, which we agreed to phase out.

</span></span>No, you are wrong about "this is the only difference". Firstly, this
is not a difference, and secondly, there are much more difference.

1. The augmentation happens in hkgen, while these function are in
   hklib. Although if we remove augmentation, we have to modify
   walk_thread to yield object that are not used by them in the
   future. So neither of these functions do any augmentation. (Are you
   sure you are looking at PostDB.walk_thread and not
   hkgen.Generator.walk_thread?)

2. On a high level, these functions do similar things (walking and
   creating post items) to different things (given thread
   structure/posts in cycles in the post database) in a different
   way. That's why they have similar names, but they are different
   functions. Walking the structure is much more complicated than
   walking the posts in cycles in a flat way. Just look at the
   docstrings of the functions or their parameter list. I don't think
   it would make any sense to make one function from them.

That said, we could have a function that walks over a flat list of
posts. That could be walk_postset or walk_postlist. That would also
have different parameters, because that does not use a thread
structure.
