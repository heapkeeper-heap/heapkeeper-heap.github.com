<pre class="postbody">In a previous post [1] you described that you tried to understand how
a certain piece of Hk code works.

I'm wondering whether test cases may help you to understand what a
function actually does. I don't have experience in understanding code
by looking at test cases that other people wrote, but I'm curious if
it helps you.

</span></span>I think I initially wanted to use this approach, but I couldn't find
the test for this function. I think your convention on test cases will
help those who are looking for the right test case when looking for
examples.
