<pre class="postbody">== Issue tracker ==

GitHub announced that they now have an integrated issue tracker
system. The announcement page [1] also contains a list of features and
a 4-minute video.

== Developer interface ==

It has an open interface that can be used e.g. with curl or people can
write own web pages which have posts that interact with github. [2]

Example:

    $ curl <a href="http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/list/schacon/simplegit/open">http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/list/schacon/simplegit/open</a>

== Python command line interface ==

Someone even created a Python command line interface [3].

A few examples (there any many more examples in [3]):

ghi list [-s open|closed|all]         # show open, closed or all
                                      # issues (default: open)

ghi [-s o|c|a] -v                     # same as above, but with issue
                                      # details

ghi open                              # create a new issue (with
                                      # $EDITOR)

ghi label add &lt;label&gt; &lt;nr&gt;            # add &lt;label&gt; to issue &lt;nr&gt;

ghi search &lt;term&gt; [-s open|closed]    # search for &lt;term&gt; in open or
                                      # closed issues (default: open)

</span></span>This open nature and, of course, the Python interface is very
commendable. Now we'd have to decide if we choose to use them, or
continue to use our 'todo' mechanism. I must admit I like the todo
file better. It can be shaped more precisely to our needs, and can be
version-controlled along with the rest of the changes.

Using an issue tracker outside the project's repository would only
make sense when others start using Heapkeeper. Which could/should/may
happen any minute now.

</span></span>What do you say to using GitHub's tracker for small bugs that should
be fixed, and the todo file for everything else (features,
refactorings, conceptual problems)? Just to try out.

Producing Open Source Software says about bug and issue tracking [1]:

    The importance of a bug tracking system lies not only in its
    usefulness to developers, but in what it signifies for project
    observers. For many people, an accessible bug database is one of
    the strongest signs that a project should be taken seriously.
    Furthermore, the higher the number of bugs in the database, the
    better the project looks. This might seem counterintuitive, but
    remember that the number of bugs recorded really depends on three
    things: the absolute number of bugs present in the software, the
    number of users using the software, and the convenience with which
    those users can register new bugs. Of these three factors, the
    latter two are more significant than the first. Any software of
    sufficient size and complexity has an essentially arbitrary number
    of bugs waiting to be discovered. The real question is, how well
    will the project do at recording and prioritizing those bugs? A
    project with a large and well-maintained bug database (meaning
    bugs are responded to promptly, duplicate bugs are unified, etc.)
    therefore makes a better impression than a project with no bug
    database, or a nearly empty database.

    Of course, if your project is just getting started, then the bug
    database will contain very few bugs, and there's not much you can
    do about that. But if the status page emphasizes the project's
    youth, and if people looking at the bug database can see that most
    filings have taken place recently, they can extrapolate from that
    that the project still has a healthy rate of filings, and they
    will not be unduly alarmed by the low absolute number of bugs
    recorded.

    Note that bug trackers are often used to track not only software
    bugs, but enhancement requests, documentation changes, pending
    tasks, and more. The details of running a bug tracker are covered
    in the section called “Bug Tracker” in Chapter 3, Technical
    Infrastructure, so I won't go into them here. The important thing
    from a presentation point of view is just to have a bug tracker,
    and to make sure that fact is visible from the front page of the
    project."

I'm starting to handle this book as a Bible...

</span></span>I strongly agree this. OK, I've been convinced.

But due to the simplicity of Hk, any small bug is just about as easily
fixed as committed to the issue tracker.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I'm starting to handle this book as a Bible...

</span></span>Yeah, I can see. But that's not much of a problem: we have always had
our fundamental scriptures in this field.

BTW. what is the "Bible" for Python?

</span></span>I don't think there is a book that has that role. The documentation is
the most obvious candidate, that's what I always almost use. The best
(free) Python book is probably the one called Dive Into Python:

<pre class="postbody">Yes, I used that as an introduction, too, but I think it is far from
the perfection of a Bible. I don't really know what it lacks. A Bible
is at the very same time serious and easy to read.

I've read only a bit more than a hundred pages of Stroustrup's book,
and I think it has the language use that is perfect for a professional
Bible. Much, much better than K&amp;R's book, despite K&amp;R being native
English speakers (to the best of my knowledge). Programming in Lua is
also fantastic.

(Perhaps we prefer non-native writers because we aren't natives
either? Well, if I remember correctly, Dive Into Python is written by
an Indian.)
