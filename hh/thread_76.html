<pre class="postbody">When a post contains a commit id, the HTML page of that post could
link to the github page of the specified commit.

Post:

    I have looked at commit 83d64452be, and

Post page:

    I have looked at commit
    &lt;a href="<a href="http://github.com/hcs42/heap/commit/83d64452be5b273d8386ca6ef374adfec739ca56%22>">http://github.com/hcs42/heap/commit/83d64452be5b273d8386ca6ef374adfec739ca56"&gt;</a>
    83d64452be&lt;/a&gt;, and

Maybe we should have something that tells the parser to parse that
word as a commit id. We could use a "commit" meta text to indicate
that the next line contains an SHA-id:

    [commit]
    I have looked at commit 83d64452be, and

Probably we should look for an extendable solution, because anyone
should be able to have their own syntax thingies.

</span></span>An intriguing idea. We need something like this for the auto-linking
of URLs in the body. I suggest that we keep either a list of
regexp-based transformation rules, or, probably better, a list of
body-transforming functions for such purposes.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Maybe we should have something that tells the parser to parse that

</span></span>My idea would be to recognise the format "commit\s\+[0-9a-f]\+".

A problem: we won't use all 40 digits of the SHA-1 hash, but github
needs all of them in the URL. No really simple solution for this, I'm
afraid. Manipulator will have to call on git to get the full hash from
the short one.

It should be easy to specify which repo to link to, perhaps w.r.t.
tags. E.g. with any of the Heap tags present, commit IDs could link to
the Heap repo, while commit IDs in posts tagged "linux" could link to
relevant commits in the Linux repo.

</span></span>And you don't have spaces after the '&gt;' signs. The funny thing is that
Thunderbird hides these funny things from me: it shows a space
after the quote sign and it shows 'Re' instead of 'RE'. (Although it
does not hide the lack of line breaks.)

Maybe we should insert spaces after the '&gt;' in order to unify the format?

</span></span>I hate this idiotic e-mail client of the PocketPC! It simply sucks.
However, I can't avoid using it for now. Spaces after &gt;s are easily
added; long lines concern me more. Should I tag these posts as ppc? Or
should we autodetect posts with long lines?

</span></span>I use this method for now. Always check the subject and remove
inaccurate ppc tags, preferably before posting. (But since this is the
Heap, that is not essential, only makes our life easier :) )

</span></span>Maybe it would be better to use meta-text "[ppc]" as the first line
instead of a tag? Of course it's not a problem in either way: if we
write a line-break function, we can say "break the lines in the posts
with [ppc] tag from Attis and remove all [ppc] tags".
