I use both of these, but it would be better to choose one of them and

I think this is a conflict between the original meaning of the word
and the new one that we created.

And it's not even that simple. A real-world heap behaves a bit like a
stack. You can only put things "on" it, but things might be "on" it
(if it's not yet covered by other items), or "in" it (if it is).

Talking about stacks, the data structures, we can also say that
something is "on the stack", which, at least to me, seems to suggest
that it's been recently pushed, or we can say that something is
"stored in the stack", which suggests that it may be anywhere, not
necessarily near the top.

I don't think we need to make this distinction with heaps. Heaps are
mailing list archives. Things are *in* an archive, not *on* them. But
I think we should say that both forms are correct, with "in the heap"
being the preferred form.

What do you think?
