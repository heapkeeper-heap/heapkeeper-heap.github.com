<pre class="postbody">We already mentioned that the [r]/[revised]/[reviewed] tag [1] is a
special one, as it makes sense on all heaps, regardless of the topic.
Therefore, I think it might make sense to give it special behavior.
(Possibly use it as a new header type like "Reviewed: true"?)

Right now, this feature is just another tag, and displayed as a tag.
But I think it would make sense to display it more visually, eg. as an
icon, or a different text color in the index. Reviewed tags could
have, for example, a small green circle with a tick in it. Then, the
editors would be able to quickly spot which messages lack final
approval.

<pre class="postbody">Nice idea.

I think for most new features (like the [r] tag) we could have a few
stages:
1. It is just a new tag that we use by convention.
2. We customize our heap to handle it specially.
3. If we think it is worth to implement specific support, we do so.

For the moment, I think, we should step into stage 2 (which would
require custom postsummary-customization that I plan anyway).

</span></span>What do you mean?

I already stepped into this stage. My hkrc removes all reviewed posts
from "tidy" and "todo" sections.

You said:

</span></span>If we implement the "custom post summary" feature (that I certainly
want to implement at some point, I just have more important stuff like
hkshell and docs), you could do this, as well. And you could be even
more in step 2 :)

<pre class="postbody">You already proposed a while ago [1] that it could be a flag.

Right now, the whole flag mechanism exists because of deleted posts.
But it is there, and it's a great place for those tags that have aged
to the point of becoming part of the infrastructure.

<pre class="postbody">No, I don't want "todo" to be a flag either. It _will be_ a meta
attribute; why should it be something else, too? Why isn't it enough,
if it is _only_ meta attribute? Heapkeeper is (or will be with the
"custom post summary feature") flexible enough so that we don't need
to convert a meta attribute into anything else in order to display it
in the required way.

Every information that belongs to a post should be described only in
one place in a post file. We may generate any number of lazy data
attributes for the Post from them, but the core information should be
as redundancy-free, as possible. If we had the "todo" tag both as a
meta attribute (with the attached meta text) and a flag or tag, the
post would be unnecessarily redundant.

<div class="body">
<pre class="postbody">I have been thinking about this, and meta attribute is as good as a
flag, even if we don't have the "custom post summary" feature! If we
want "todo" to be displayed specially in the post summary, we have to
hard-code displaying posts with "todo" differently in either case --
it is just that if we have a flag, we have to hard-code "if the post
has a 'todo' flag, do X", while if it is only a meta attribute, we
have to hard-code "if the post has meta attribute 'todo', do X".

I also have been thinking about why do you insist on having a flag for
'todo'. If it is sheer misunderstanding, I hope this thread helps. But
I realized you may have another concern: performance. You don't want
to parse all posts all the time when only generating an index. I have
to assure you, though, that having a "todo" flag is not the right
solution to this performance issue: there are much better and much more
generic solutions. (I'll talk about one if you are curious.)

<div class="body">
<pre class="postbody">OK. We have three orthogonal questions:

1. Should "todo" be a flag or only a meta attribute?
2. Do we want to display "todo" specially?
3. Should we hardcode special things like this, or should we just
   allow customization? If the second one, how should it be done?

1. This subthread (starting at 2009-05-11) was about the first question,
   which has been answered thoroughly.

2. Maybe we should open another thread about the second question on
   HH -- maybe you can also point me to an old thread on the UMS Heap? I
   don't have a strong opinion on the question.

3. Now you said this is your concern. I agree that it is a very
   important issue, but this is a much deeper question than how to
   handle "todo". We can open another thread if we want to deal with it
   or talk about is now, or we can wait until we have more experience in
   Heapkeeper customization.
