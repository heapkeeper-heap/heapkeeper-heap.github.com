  Merge: b996200... 102f5fd...
  Author: Attila Nagy &lt;nagy.attila.1984@gmail.com&gt;

      Merge branch 'master' of git@github.com:hcs42/heapkeeper

      Conflicts:

          hkrc_attis.py

      nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git
      add" to track)

I don't know how this could happen. Do you have an idea? If not,
please, be aware next time when you merge branches, and try to find
the root of the problem. (I'm very curious.)

The same error occurred in 2009-05-15 a48ce4f17f8. I checked in the
git log and it has never happened before.

</span></span>I must admit I made a mess of the threads, and I had many conflicts that
day. Still, I don't know how I did an empty commit. Maybe I forgot a "-a"
option? I thought that results in failure of the commit. Maybe it doesn't?

</span></span>&lt;&lt;&lt;todo You mean branch.&gt;&gt;&gt;

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; and I had many conflicts that day. Still, I don't know how I did an
&gt; empty commit.

</span></span>I have to admit I have no idea what was going on. But as far as I see,
that was not an empty commit, but a commit with a funny commit
message.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Maybe I forgot a "-a" option? I thought that results in failure of
&gt; the commit. Maybe it doesn't?

</span></span>If it was a merge, it has nothing to do with "-a".

I also have to admit, as much as I love git, it is not easy to use.
For me the current nuisance in git is that when I say "git push", it
complains that it won't push the bodyparsing branch - even though I
did nothing on that branch.
