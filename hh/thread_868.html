quite a few times, but usually I caught it before commit. I know there
is one commit in the repo now in the _hcs branch that does have the
wrong topic, but I hope all the others are OK. I'm writing this
because you made the same mistake in the commit message of
hkrc-attis-newgen.

mechanism, that is, export the branch into a text file, edit the
commit messages, then re-import it.

On the current case: I was reluctant to correct it, because all the
other branches are built on the top of _hcs. But I'll do it then.

</span></span>I don't like the topic "[new generation page generation]", it is not
evident (at least to me) that you mean a HTML page. How about simply
using "[new generator]" or "[new HTML generator]"?

<pre class="postbody">Hm. At some point I said something like "what if we use the word
'page' to mean 'HTML page'". (Maybe it is even present somewhere in
the documentation.) I think it is a nice shortcut; for example it is
nice that we don't write "print_*_html_page", only "print_*_page".
What do you think about this?

I think the pun is made more obvious and, at the same time, more
subtle by simply writing "new generation" as the topic. What do you
think?

</span></span>The words "page" and "post" are too similar...

I haven't realized that there are 5 commits like that, I thought it
was only one. Probably this fact indicates that the topic name is not
so good, no matter how funny I think it is :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I think the pun is made more obvious and, at the same time, more
&gt; subtle by simply writing "new generation" as the topic. What do you
&gt; think?

</span></span>Well, I would not think "new generation" describes the changes more
obviously than "new generation page generation". If I look at it, I
wait for the continuation ("OK, new generation what?")

So I don't like the green for the bikeshed and you don't like the red.
Do you have any other suggestions? If not, then let's go with "new
generator" (which you proposed) or "generator rewrite".
