<pre class="post-body-content">I think the names of programming objects should be written exactly as
they are, without capitalizing them. For example you should not write:

<span class="raw-block">    Hklib is a nice module.
</span>
But you should write:

<span class="raw-block">    hklib is a nice module.
</span>
This is true for commit messages, documentation, etc.

Do you agree?

Why is it that important to keep capitalization consistent with the

never make use of this feature, AND the commit messages will always be

And there are much more that are not capitalized.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Thus, we have to choose between being consistent with these or with
&gt; the code.
</span></span>
Have a look at the commit messages. You are being consistent with most
of them and with the code at the same time: if you don't capitalize
them.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Why is it that important to keep capitalization consistent with the
&gt; code? Of course, Python is case-sensitive, but my guess is that we'll
&gt; never make use of this feature,
</span></span>
We do! We have a lot of variables called "post". Just two examples:

<span class="raw-block">    $ grep 'post = Post' *.py
    hklib.py:                    post = Post.from_file(absname, heapid, self)
    hklib.py:        post = Post.create_empty()

</span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; AND the commit messages will always be aimed at human readers.
</span></span>
I, as a human reader, would like to see a module's name with the right
capitalization. If you read a thesis or an article in a programming
topic -- it is aimed at human readers, but they don't capitalize
variables' name. That would be simply confusing.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Thus, a message like:
&gt;
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1"><span class="raw-block">&gt;     Hklib: corrected bugs

</span></span>
Why not? How does a reader know whether it is a class or a module? We
don't have a rule that the first word is a module. Maybe we will write
at some point:

<span class="raw-block">    Generator: new methods gen_thread and thread added

No problem. I'm not keen on keeping the commit history as tidy as a
heap. Linus said something like people usually don't go back to much
earlier commits, they care only about the last few changes (e.g. last
one month?) That's a good idea to write nice commit messages though,
first of all for each other, and second of all to get accustomed to
writing nice messages.

<pre class="post-body-content">They say history is the teacher of life. Why not? Some form of
software history is already being taught, the ancient history of UNIX
and C is already part of university curricula.

Good and bad decisions of large and long-running projects (Linux, X,
Mozilla etc.) are very probably enlightening to a programmer in
training.

What is also very probably interesting besides the big changes is the
everyday workflow of a project during different periods of its
development.

<pre class="post-body-content">Someone said in a podcast that as there are books which are compulsory
(or advised) to read, there should be programs that are compulsory (or
advised) to read. The problem is we don't have the culture of reading
source code. In the secondary schools and universities there are
canonical algorithms which have to be learnt by heart and which we
have to talk and reason about, and it is similar in the case of
mathematical definitions, theorems and proofs; but there is no such
thing regarding source code.

So a "software historian" (in my view) is not a person who is only
interested in the history of algorithms, concept, methodologies and
technologies; but also in the history of particular projects and
programs. Of course, as "normal" historian don't care about most
people, only about the very important ones (great leaders,
philosophers, scientists and artists), a software historian would not
care about most projects and programs, only about a few ones like the
Linux kernel.

I can't really imagine how it is useful that someone knows the history
of Linux kernel between 1992 and 1997, but hey -- I can't imagine how
it is useful that someone knows the history of the Greco-Persian wars.
