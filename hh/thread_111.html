<pre class="post-body-content">The new design is ready and committed. It is a quite faithful replica
of the Vim Online site's design.

I'm eager to hear your opinion.

As for myself, I like it at first glimpse, which usually mean I'll
like it even more once I got used to it. I miss the sense of wildness
the old design somehow made me feel. The barbarian raider from among
the Sand Heaps visited a barber's shop, bought an elegant, though a
bit oldish suit, and sat down to work in an office.
