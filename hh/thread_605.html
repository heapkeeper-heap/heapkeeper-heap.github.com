<pre class="post-body-content">Csabi has already identified this problem, and took some measures to solve
it. In his commit entitled "$EDITOR may contain spaces", he did this:

<span class="raw-block">    -    subprocess.call(editor.split() + files)
    +    quoted_files = [ ("'%s'" % file) for file in files ]
    +    subprocess.call(editor + ' ' + ' '.join(files), shell=True)
</span>
This, however, has two problems. First, the actual subprocess call
doesn't use the result of the list comprehension. It should read:

<span class="raw-block">    quoted_files = [ ("'%s'" % file) for file in files ]
    subprocess.call(editor + ' ' + ' '.join(quoted_files), shell=True)
</span>
But this is still not OK. In Python, single and double quotes are created
equal. In the shell, they are not. In bash, the single quote means "raw",
ie. no substitution and no escaping occurs inside them. E.g.:

<span class="raw-block">    $ echo "$term"
    xterm
    $ echo '$term'
    $TERM
</span>
And also this:

<span class="raw-block">    $ echo "\""
    "
</span>
is valid, and works, while this:

<span class="raw-block">    $ echo '\''
</span>
will result in an unterminated line.

To correctly handle both kinds of quotes in file names, neither quote
type will suffice, we'll have to use escaping, like this:

<span class="raw-block">    quoted_files = [ ('"%s"' % file.replace('"', r'\"'))
                     for file in files ]
    subprocess.call(editor + ' ' + ' '.join(quoted_files), shell=True)
</span>
That is, we pass double-quoted filenames to the shell, with escaping
any double quotes in the filename.

Sadly, this is not everything. Links pointing to URLs containing
double quotes won't work. This is because a link pointing to the HTML
generated from a post called "''".post (I know I'm a pervert) looks
like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;a href=""''".html"&gt;
</span>
Of course this derails the HTML parser in Firefox. This can be
corrected by HTML-escaping the double quotes, like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;a href="%22''%22.html"&gt;
</span></pre></div><!-- post-summary -->
