<pre class="postbody">I'd like to assign some meta information to the issues.

For example:
- how much effort is it to implement them
- when do we plan to do it (Heapkeeper version)
- is it assigned to someone
- what is the priority

I will not be strict about writing these about every issue, but it can
be useful sometimes if we can express our thoughts about these
questions in a "standard" way, which can even be displayed by Heapkeeper.

== Effort ==

An estimate about how much effort is it to solve the issue in hours.
Documentation, testing and writing the commit message are included.

== Version ==

The version of Heapkeeper in which we plan to implement the issue,
e.g. "0.4".

== Assigned to someone ==

If a task is assigned to someone, others should not work on it, in
order to avoid wasted efforts.

== Priority ==

I don't really know yet what priorities should be have. I propose
to use words like "high", "normal", "low". I guess "normal" is the
default priority.

<pre class="postbody">The only thing I don't like about this proposal is the syntax (not
covered in the proposal, but the syntax of actual usage). You write
metas like this:

    [effort: 4]

I don't like the colon. We said the first word is special in metas, so
the colon is not necessary to separate the first word. (Of course if
we say the name of the meta is "effort:" and not "effort", that's
another matter.)

<div class="body">
<pre class="postbody">I haven't realized I'm writing a colon and we talked about not writing
them. You are right about the contradiction.

Meta text are handled incorrectly, not the way we agreed on. Currently
a dictionary of metas will be created. I'll just write examples and
you will get the idea:

    Post body:
        [effort: 1]
        [important]

    Meta dict:
        {'effort': 1,
         'important': ''}

This seems to be all right. Problems:

    Post:
        [effort: 1]
        [effort: 2]
        [important]
        [!todo many things]
        [!todo this]
    Meta dict:
        {'effort': 2,
         'important': '',
         '!todo many things':'',
         '!todo this': ''}

I propose to generate a dictionary like this for the post similar to
the latter post:

    Post:
        [effort 1]     # no colons
        [effort 2]
        [important]
        [!todo many things]
        [!todo this]
    Meta dict:
        {'effort', [1, 2],
         'important': [''],
         '!todo': ['many things', 'this']}

So a non-empty list of strings will be assigned to each meta that is
present in the post body.

If you don't get the idea of what's wrong with the current dictionary
and how should the new work, ask.
