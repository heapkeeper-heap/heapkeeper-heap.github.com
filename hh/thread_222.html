<pre class="post-body-content">It would be useful to see which proposals and other threads are open
that demand attention and which ones are closed. Hereby I propose a
method which helps us to track this.

(In this post I will use only two angle-brackets instead of three.
This only applies to talking about them, the real implementation has
of course three. The reasons are that it is easier to write two angle
brackets, and if I use three opening angle-brackets in the beginning
of a line by accident, it will become meta text.)

Let's have two meta attributes: [open] and [close]. If a post has an
[open] attribute, it opens the thread, which means that there are
questions in that thread that have to be answered or settled. If the
original poster is satisfied with the answer, he/she posts a post that
contains a [close] attribute, which means of course that the thread is
closed. It would also be useful to reopen threads, and of course close
them again. This could be done by posting [open] and [close]
attributes again.

The algorithm that determines the state of a thread:
- o is the number of posts in the thread with [open] attribute
- c is the number of posts in the thread with [close] attribute
1. if o==c==0, the thread is normal.
2. if o&gt;c, the thread is open.
3. if o=c, the thread is closed.
4. if o&lt;c, the thread is funny. (Should be corrected by the
   maintainer.)

Everybody can have their own customization on how to handle this
information: have a different index for the open threads, have them is
a different section, display them with different colors etc. My
proposal is not about the customization, and whether it would be
built-in or not; it is purely about this convention being used on HH
ASAP.

<pre class="post-body-content">OK.

I have also been thinking about such a mechanism, and I like your solution.
