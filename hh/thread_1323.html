<pre class="post-body-content">Why did you add "idea" tag to this thread?

As I put it in <a href="../hh/thread_763.html#post-summary-hh-772">heap://hh/772</a>:

<span class="raw-block">    Being an "idea" means that the proposer is not sure about whether
    the feature/issue/proposal is useful/implementable.
</span>
As you put it in <a href="../hh/thread_763.html#post-summary-hh-1059">heap://hh/1059</a>:

<span class="raw-block">    Any of these may optionally have the "idea" tag, which means that
    the author has xyr own doubts about the usefulness or feasibility
    of the contents of the post.
</span>
This thread is about a bug that is certainly a bug. Its fix is both
useful and implementable. In general, it is very rare that a thread
should have both a "bug" and an "idea" tag. Also, "idea" tags should
be added to ideas that we don't want to implement right now; I think
this bug should be fixed right now (because it is so easy). Actually,
I just did...

You seem to use the "idea" tag too much recently. The "Implementing
deleting posts" thread [1] should not have an idea tag. I would not
have given it to the "Implementing post splitting" thread [2] either,
but I'm not so sure about that one.

I wasn't at all certain that it is a bug. If it is OK in JS to do
this, then it's not a bug.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; In general, it is very rare that a thread
&gt; should have both a "bug" and an "idea" tag.
</span></span>
I used the "unsureness" present in the meaning of "idea" to express
that I'm not sure if it is a bug. But now that you point it out, the
more precise concepts of "feasibility" or "usefulness" do not seem to
apply to bugs at all, so I will not use the "bug" and "idea" tags
together.

Do you think we should have a special way to denote potential bugs, or
we should simply use the "bug" tag for these?

Simply "bug" is enough.

</span></span>
I believe I can explain myself here: I wasn't sure we wanted this. A
"Delete" button with no undo feature in place could result in
accidental deletion of posts. It seems nice to have to change to
hkshell to delete a post as a safeguard against accidental use.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I would not have given it to the "Implementing post splitting"

</span></span>
This is different. I need this feature, so no usefulness question
here. Of course it is feasible, but the difficulty of implementation
was a question; though now that I'm halfway there, it doesn't seem
that difficult. I added the "idea" tag there because I wasn't sure it
was worth the effort.
