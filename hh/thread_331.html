<pre class="post-body-content">We should have some kind of method for quoting sources.

For example, how should we write if we want to quote Asimov? Is this OK?

<span class="raw-block">    Asimov said once:

        "I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my
        whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For
        whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven
        would be even worse."
</span>
Solution 1: Let's say if a "raw text" starts with quotation mark, than
it is not raw text but a quote.

Solution 2: Let's have a marker that indicates that the following "raw
text" is a quote:

<span class="raw-block">    Asimov said once: [quote]

        "I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my
        whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For
        whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven
        would be even worse."
</span>
This is an important issue if we don't want to see quotes between
&lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;. I don't want to.

No. This would totally invalidate the usefulness of a raw segment.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Solution 2: Let's have a marker that indicates that the following "raw

I like this solution. Keeps both the email and the HTML nice and readable.
