<pre class="postbody">We should have some kind of method for quoting sources.

For example, how should we write if we want to quote Asimov? Is this OK?

    Asimov said once:

        "I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my
        whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For
        whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven
        would be even worse."

Solution 1: Let's say if a "raw text" starts with quotation mark, than
it is not raw text but a quote.

Solution 2: Let's have a marker that indicates that the following "raw
text" is a quote:

    Asimov said once: [quote]

        "I don't believe in an afterlife, so I don't have to spend my
        whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more. For
        whatever the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven
        would be even worse."

This is an important issue if we don't want to see quotes between
&lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;. I don't want to.

</span></span>No. This would totally invalidate the usefulness of a raw segment.

</span></span>I like this solution. Keeps both the email and the HTML nice and readable.
