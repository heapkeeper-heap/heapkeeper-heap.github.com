       hkshell: enew accepts prefix

       If you want to create a new post with heapid myname_&lt;number&gt;,
just use this:

           &gt;&gt;&gt; enew('myname_')

       PostDB.next_heapid has been extended to handle prefixes.

Since this commit affects hklib.py as well, this should be mentioned
in the summary, like this:

   hklib, hkshell: PostDB.next_heapid, enew accepts prefix

At least I think it's the more important of the changes you've made.
But good thing you've done it, it'll be useful.

We could even have a hook that checks which modules have changed, and
pre-initializes the commit message with their names. Of course, you'd
be free to delete them, if you don't want to use it.

<pre class="postbody">I had thought about the title of this commit before commiting, and I
had similar thoughts.

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to mention all the modules that has
changed in the title; we have only 50 characters there. Your
recommendation for example is 55 characters.

I choose to mention "enew accepts prefixes", because it is easier to
comprehend and see its usefulness than do the same for
"Post.next_heapid accepts prefixes". But I might have been wrong.

I could also have cut the commit into two, but that would not make too
much sense. (It's not useful if we have many tiny commits.)

Another thought: you don't always have to state the module, you can
state a class or a method, too:

    PostDB: much nicer

or

    PostDB.next_heapid: accepts prefix

The main idea is to state the scope of the change before the colon.

So maybe the best title is the following:

    PostDB.next_heapid,hkshell.enew: accepting prefix

(We can spare the space before the colon, too.)

</span></span>You mean the one after the comma. Probably, though I'd only do that as
a last resort to cut down 51 chars to 50. My ties to typography are
strong :)
