<pre class="postbody">Previously you made a bugfix commit and rebased my branch [1] onto it
[2]. First I was happy that you did the rebase for me, but now I think
it was not a good idea. Now the commit looks like this (older commits
first):

- Attis's bugfix
- Csabi's commit 1
- ...
- Csabi's commit n
- Csabi's correction proposal to Attis's bugfix 1
- Csabi's correction proposal to Attis's bugfix 2

But I'm afraid of making new commits, since that would mess up this
branch even more.

It would have been better if we had two branches, _bugfix and _hcs.
Then I could make my new commits, and I would not need the separate
_newgen branch:

_bugfix:
    - Attis's bugfix
    - Csabi's correction proposal to Attis's bugfix 1
    - Csabi's correction proposal to Attis's bugfix 2
_hcs:
    - Csabi's commit 1
    - ...
    - Csabi's commit n
    - Csabi's new commit 1
    - ...
    - Csabi's new commit n

As Linus said, it is not good practice for Linux developers to pull in
random points of Linus's master branch. I would say, regarding our
workflow, that it is not good practice to rebase random points of
other's branches into your branches.

Previously we talked about every branch having one person who is
responsible for the branch (unfortunately this discussion was in
Hungarian, and outside of UMS/hh).

This branch is no neither mine, nor yours. Would you agree that we
should not have branches like this? It is unclear whose responsibility
is to clean up this branch and merge into the master.

If you agree, I will take it apart: I will make a separate
_star-bugfix and a _hcs branch.

I was desperate to make a concrete goal and concrete rules about how
the development would be easier, but I haven't managed to reach a
conclusion.

[1] If a branch is "my branch", it means that "it contains my changes
    and other people's corrections about my changes, and when everyone
    seems to be satisfied with it, I should merge/rebase it into my
    master".

</span></span>Was it on skype? It sounds reasonable, so we should write a proposal
and make it official.

</span></span>OK. I am right now busy reading commits up to 0.3, so thanks for doing it.

</span></span>I'm ready.

You probably want to delete your remote branches called _hcs-bugfix,
_bugfix, _newgen and __hkweb.

You probably also want to make a patch from _hkrc-tidy-attis and apply
it to the master, and make a new _hkrc-tidy-attis branch. Don't forget
to include a tag to the commit message; I recommend "Attis's hkrc".
