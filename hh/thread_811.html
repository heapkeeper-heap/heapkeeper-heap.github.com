<pre class="postbody">The new `PostDB.next_heapid()` function introduced in the commit
"PostDB.next_heapid, hkshell.enew: accepting prefix" (2009-09-06,
0582aec) handles prefixes in addition to the previous version's
functionality.

The problem is that the "next heapid" is calculated in a radically
different way for empty and non-empty prefixes (that is, with or
without prefix). Without a prefix, the function returns a heapid that
is larger than any heapid that is a number. With a prefix, a heapid is
returned that is composed of the given prefix and a number for which
there is no unused heapid with a smaller number and the same prefix.

As an example, create an empty post directory, and add any two valid
post files with the names `2.post` and `a_2.post`. Then, execute these
in hkshell:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; postdb().next_heapid()
    '3'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; postdb().next_heapid('a_')
    'a_1'

You see my point: in one case, the number returned will be larger than
any other, in the other, it finds the first one available.

The obvious and known difference is that in the unprefixed case, the
result is cached, while when a (non-empty) prefix is given, the result
is newly constructed. But the caching and the definition of "next
heapid" should be orthogonal.

Thus, we can have two aims:
- make the definition of "next heapid" consistent for non-prefixed and
  prefixed use,
- enable caching for non-empty prefixes.

Of these, the latter one is harder to achieve, but still not a very
hard task.

I think the former behavior is more reasonable, the one which
disregards filling the gaps in the numbering, and always gives the
largest available number. This way, numerical sorting of heapids tend
to yield a more chronological order of posts.

Another, somewhat unrelated issue is that the unprefixed call increases
the counter, which is in my opinion, counter-intuitive. If the
function would be called `step_heapid()`, I would expect it to
increase the counter, while the current name only suggests an innocent
getter with no such side-effect.

Another inconsistency is that numbering starts from 0 without
prefixes, and from 1 with prefixes.

</span></span>I have solved these in two distinct commits on the `_next_heapid`
branch.

</span></span>I haven't changed this, but we could still rename the function to
`step_heapid`. However, previously only the empty prefix could do this
"stepping", the other prefixes returned the same name on consequent
calls. Now the non-empty prefixes step their numbering the same way
the empty prefix does.

</span></span>I haven't changed this, though it would be trivial.

</span></span>I think "next" functions are accepted to have side-effects. Have a
look at the iterator.next() function [1], which you use all the time
implicitly when writing for-loops. It sets the value that is to be
returned next time, which is a side effect. (Exactly the kind of
side-effect we have in our next.)

This is not so only it Python: Java programmers do the same.
