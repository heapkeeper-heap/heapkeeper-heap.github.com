<pre class="post-body-content">"Stars" (now rendered as dashes to denote repeating subject or tags)
should not be generated in flat sections, but some commit between
"master" and current "_hcs" (which is now at 2009-10-18 'hkshell: "exc
for non-existing posts" bug fixed') introduced this bug.

I did a bisect and it revealed this commit to be 2009-09-13
'Generator.section: uses the new `thread` method'. However, since this
commit does nothing but enable code added in the previous commit, it
is rather 2009-09-13 'Generator: postitem* methods added' that
introduced the glitch.

Code present in both `Generator.postitem_subject()` and
`Generator.postitem_tags()` decide whether the "star" would be used
instead of these fields. However, these latter functions do not care
whether the PostItem is flat or not, which results in the generation
of inappropriate stars.  The good thing is that they just as easily
could care, since the PostItem object is propagated to them, together
with the information on flatness. These functions already determine if
they can use a star, this test just needs to be expanded to test for
flat PostItems.

This test:

<span class="raw-block">    if (postitem.pos != 'flat' and
        options.shorttags and parent != None and
        tags == parent.tags()):
</span>
began to look to complicated, so it needed a comment, besides it was
present in both `Generator.postitem_subject()` and
`Generator.postitem_tags()`, so I created a new
`Generator.postitem_star_needed()` to check whether a star is needed.
It is written to be generic, so if someone wants to include authors in
the "starring" process, it can be used for that, too.

This new function takes an argument, `param`, as the name of the
`Post` attribute to examine. Thus, if you choose to use it in
`Generator.postitem_subject()`, you can automatically use the option
`shortauthor` to enable or disable abbreviation of the author field.

I committed this bugfix to the branch "_bugfix" on my heapkeeper repo.
I also pushed a branch called "_hcs-bugfix", which is the rest of your
"_hcs" branch rebased on this bugfix.

A test case which checks if stars are generated in flat sections might
be useful.

<pre class="post-body-content">Very well done! Indeed, I forgot about this case. You implemented
exactly the same solution that I would have implemented if I had
realized this problem.

I'll try not to forget to incorporate this change into the new generator.

Yes, we should write tests about this. These functions are a bit
different in the old and new generators, so I think it is enough if we
promise that we will write test cases for the new Generator :)

A few notes:

1. I would rename postitem_star_needed to postitem_is_star_needed. I
like the convention that the names of boolean functions contain the
word "is".

2. According to our docstring conventions (which are not written down
anywhere...),

<span class="raw-block">    - *postitem* (:class:`PostItem`) - the PostItem being examined
    - *param* (`str`) - the name of the parameter to examine,
</span>
would become

<span class="raw-block">    - `postitem` (|PostItem|) - the post item being examined
    - `param` (str) - the name of the parameter to examine,
</span>
3. The itemization after "We can use a star if the following
conditions are all met:" is incorrect, because Sphinx needs an empty
line before the itemization. So it should be like this:

<span class="raw-block">        We can use a star if the following conditions are all met:

        - using stars is enabled (`shortsubject`, `shorttags` options),
        - PostItem is not flat,
        - the post described has a parent,
        - the property being examined is the same as that of the parent.
</span>
That's why we put an empty line after "**Arguments:**"
