<pre class="post-body-content">Currently, when the user issues the g() command in hkshell, we try to
decide which HTML files should be regenerated based on the timestamps
of the HTML files, the post files, and whether or not the post object
is in "modified" state. Although the code is smart that deals with
this, but it is not smart enough: <a href="../hh/thread_926.html#post-summary-hh-926">heap://hh/926</a> and <a href="../hh/thread_926.html#post-summary-hh-1056">heap://hh/1056</a>
describe two problems. I think that there are other problems as well
that we are not aware of, and it may make it harder to create new
plugins, because this question has to be considered.

One possibility is to rethink the model of how this part of the code
works and rewrite it. I don't think this code is so useful that it is
worth the effort. Improving hkweb, the documentation, etc. are far
more important things to work on than this.

Another possibility is to leave the code buggy. The problem with this
is that even I don't use this feature when generating static HH pages
because these problems are quite bad; I just delete all HTML files
before invoking g(). We can't expect anyone to use this feature with
these problems.

So I propose to remove this code and always regenerating all HTML
pages. When you say that Heapkeeper code is bloated, and you want it
to be clean and simple, which is the most easy step in that direction?
Removing features and code that are not used. I don't think it is an
inherently bad thing: we implement a feature because we think we need
it, then we remove it if it turns out that it is not as useful.

I don't think this will be a problem for anyone. With the introduction
of hkweb, few people will use static HTML page generation, and much
fewer will use it in an interactive way. And this feature would be
useful only for them.

In the future, we may have other databases than post files (SQL
database that you proposed once, a single file for each heap that I'm
thinking about now, etc.), and this current question slows down the
development of those possible new features.
