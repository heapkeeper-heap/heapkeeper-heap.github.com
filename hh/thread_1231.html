<pre class="postbody"><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Csabi, how do you manage the web archive of this heap? I mean how
&gt; often do you download,

</span></span>Once a week would be the goal.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; do you have a script to automate the procedure

</span></span>Yes, but it is semi-automatic. The script downloads the new stuff,
generates the HTML files and commits the changes to my local
repositories. Then I read through the changes quickly and push them to
GitHub if they are OK. Also, it is important to note that I use the
_bugfix branch of Heapkeeper for this procedure.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Maybe we could make it a cron job on a permanently running machine?

</span></span>Maybe we should do that.

I'm more comfortable having a look at the emails before pushing them,
but if we can rewrite the history in case of a problem, it is OK to do
the commits and pushes automatically.

As far as I know, "master" branches are unrewritable once pushed to
GitHub, so in the HH repo [1], we should use another branch, to which
"master" would be manually fast forwarded.

In the repository of the HH HTML web page [2], we have to use the
"master" branch, because the web page is generated from that. But I'm
not that keen on a very clean history there, so it is not a problem.

</span></span>They aren't, you just have to be aggressive about it:

    $ git push --force origin master
