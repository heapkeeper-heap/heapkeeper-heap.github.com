<pre class="post-body-content">This commit is definitely a nice solution:

<span class="raw-block">             except:
    -            raise HeapException, \
    -                  'Error parsing message file "%s"' %  f.name
    +            raise (HeapException,
    +                  'Error parsing message file "%s"'
    +                    % getattr(f, name, ""))
</span>
But I have two comments.

== % and tuples ==

When we use the % operator, we should always use the tuple syntax.
The reason is described in the "Coding conventions" file (in the
"options_refactoring" branch):

<span class="raw-block">    - When you format a string with the % operator and you have only one
      parameter to format, use the tuple syntax.

    Yes:
        "%s" % (x,)

    No:
        "%s" % x
    No:
        "%s" % (x)

    The reason is that printing a tuple may lead to surprises. To reduce
    the possibility of a bug, always follow this convention, even if you
    are sure that the parameter after the % operator is not a tuple.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; x = (1,2)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; "%s" % (x,)
        '(1, 2)'
        &gt;&gt;&gt; "%s" % x
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
        TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
        &gt;&gt;&gt; "%s" % (x)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
        TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting

</span>
== Branches ==

Probably we should work only in the options_refactoring branch now,
otherwise we may get funny errors, especially when we don't write a
test case for some code.

For example the HeapException class has been moved to the heaplib
module. But when the master branch will be merged into the
options_refactoring branch, of course git won't realize that, and the
merged code will be the code as taken from the master branch:

<span class="raw-block">    raise (HeapException,
          'Error parsing message file "%s"'
            % getattr(f, name, ""))
</span>
While this should contain heaplib.HeapException instead of just
HeapException.

I know only two solution, and neither is perfect:
a. Let's merge the master and options_refactoring branches ASAP
b. Let's write tests that cover all code (even exception handling code)

I think (a) is more feasible in the short run.
