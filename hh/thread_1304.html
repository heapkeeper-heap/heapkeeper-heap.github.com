Do you mean that we support the empty string being used as a tag?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; The only problem with this is that a post with a single empty tag is
&gt; indistinguishable from one with no tags in the HTML output.
</span></span>
I don't think people should use the empty tag. Although you may have
the concern that a post file may get an empty tag by accident, which
will not be apparent for the maintainer who uses the hkweb. (The
problem reminds me to the situation when for example "Makefile"
becomes "MAKEFILE" when worked on by a Windows user, but the problem
will be apparent only when a Unix user gets a copy of the source
code and tries to work on it.)

I see the following options:
1. Show the empty tag specially in the HTML output.
2. Don't allow the empty tag. This means throwing an exception or a
   warning when parsing a post file with an empty tag, and/or
   modifying Post.set_tags to check for this.
3. Do nothing.

I don't really like either of these.

But with point 3 included, I don't think there's another option.

The really nasty thing about this is that this situation was caused by
an `rTr()` command! Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce it. It may be
useful to analyse the situation backwards: find the conditions under
which `rTr
()` leads to the addition of an empty tag. (I have some bad feelings
about this approach, though -- either that it won't work, or that it'd
be insanely difficult.)

</span></span>
All I know is that the empty tag was added after an rTr command, but
now that you mention it, the root probably didn't receive the empty
tag, but all the children did.

I really should have preserved the state of the heap after the
operation, maybe it could have been helpful.
