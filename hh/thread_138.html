<pre class="postbody">I propose to start making a list of those additions and new features
that we need in order to make Heapkeeper a product ready to be used by
others.

My list of what we need:
* a setup script
* an up-to-date tutorial
* a visitor-friendly web site...
** ...which very strongly encourages interested visitors to get in
(e-mail) contact with us
* a public heap?

== Do we need the interactive Web interface? ==

The first and probably most important question is: should we market
Heapkeeper as a usable product in this phase, or only when we have at
least some form of interactive Web interface.

I think having a Web interface is a nice way to go, but it's not
everything. See for example MailMan [1]. Many projects use this
mailing list manager, however it has only the kind of flat web
interface Hk already supports (of course, since it has no way of
altering history).

There is a counter-argument: if we open too soon to the world, some
may fail to recognize what we're building here. With an impressive
interactive Web interface, a higher percentage of our visitors would
be interested.

Counter-counter-argument: "Release early, release often."

</span></span>OK. It could me an item-group in the todo list.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; My list of what we need:
&gt; * a setup script

</span></span>Really? What do you mean by a setup script? A script that for example
creates hk.cfg? I'm not a fan of the idea. I think it is easier to
edit a config file based on the tutorial than answering question. As
least I hate answering questions for a script, because:
- I don't see the full picture (e.g. all questions) when answering a
 particular one.
- It is usually impossible to go back if you later realize you give an
 incorrect answer before; you can only redo the whole thing.
- You have to became familiar with the config file itself anyway if
 you want to change a setting.

The only case when it is good to have a setup script is when the
generated config file is large, e.g. in the case of Sphinx. But it's
small in our case.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; * an up-to-date tutorial

</span></span>I'm not sure about what priority should it have. I don't think you
would use it, but probably we won't catch any users without it.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; * a visitor-friendly web site...

</span></span>I will upload a skeleton for the user documentation today. Afterwards
I will wait for your suggestion of what makes our web site
visitor-friendly (besides having a decent domain).

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; ** ...which very strongly encourages interested visitors to get in
&gt; (e-mail) contact with us

</span></span>Very true. A mailing list...?

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; * a public heap?

</span></span>Also very true.

</span></span>There is a difference: they do have a server.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; There is a counter-argument: if we open too soon to the world, some

</span></span>True.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Counter-counter-argument: "Release early, release often."

</span></span>POSS says about "Development Status" [1]:

  People always want to know how a project is doing. For new projects,
  they want to know the gap between the project's promise and current
  reality. For mature projects, they want to know how actively it is
  maintained, how often it puts out new releases, how responsive it is
  likely to be to bug reports, etc.

  To answer these questions, you should provide a development status
  page, listing the project's near-term goals and needs (for example,
  it might be looking for developers with a particular kind of
  expertise). The page can also give a history of past releases, with
  feature lists, so visitors can get an idea of how the project
  defines "progress" and how quickly it makes progress according to
  that definition.

  Don't be afraid of looking unready, and don't give in to the
  temptation to hype the development status. Everyone knows that
  software evolves by stages; there's no shame in saying "This is
  alpha software with known bugs. It runs, and works at least some of
  the time, but use at your own risk." Such language won't scare away
  the kinds of developers you need at that stage. As for users, one of
  the worst things a project can do is attract users before the
  software is ready for them. A reputation for instability or
  bugginess is very hard to shake, once acquired. Conservativism pays
  off in the long run; it's always better for the software to be more
  stable than the user expected than less, and pleasant surprises
  produce the best kind of word-of-mouth.

I'm not sure what to make out of this in our case.

To answer to your "first and probably most important question": we
should just say the truth. The index pages now says this:

  Currently Heapkeeper is a console tool with the following features:

  [...]

  We plan to implement a web version of the tool in the future. It
  would download new emails automatically, and it would have a web
  interface for modifying the heap.

If you think it is not clear enough, you may suggest how to make these
statements even more explicit. But if a user reads these lines,
especially that Hk is a console tool, they will give Hk a try only if
they are hard-core users and developers. And they are whom can join
the development, as POSS says.

product to use, the ability to provide a user experience in a few

Believe me -- I've been at the other end of this situation plenty of times.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - I don't see the full picture (e.g. all questions) when answering a

</span></span>You are right, but just think of .git/config. It's neither long nor
overly complicated, and it could perfectly be written by hand; still
it's a huge gain you don't have to do it every time you set up a new
repository. (Yes, I know, you don't set up a new repository all that
often, but some people version control everything, including saved
games :P)

</span></span>Of course a setup script doesn't have to be dumb. It takes love, care

things like elegant ncurses-based setup scripts with 'back' and 'next'
options.

</span></span>It is impossible to use Hk without looking through at least the index
page and the a tutorial. If the user starts a setup script, he/she
won't be able to answer to the questions ("where is the user name that
belongs to the IMAP account of heap?"). And if he/she reads the
tutorial, what is easier to say?
a. Put these lines into the hk.cfg: ...
b. Start the setup script; when it ask question X, answer Y; when it
   asks W, answer Z; ...

Although I admit that the setup script can be useful in creating the
"mail" and "html" directories.

</span></span>I don't :)

</span></span>Valid point. A difference though: "git init" does not ask me any

</span></span>I would not call a character-graphical program a "setup script". I would
not even call it a "script".

If you want to do a setup program that you described, it' OK, do it.
(I'm curious about these software, but as you want to read POSS with
my eyes, I want to try these out with your hands.) But a setup program
that matches Hk's (wanted) quality indeed seems to be a lot of work.
A tutorial would be much less work, and I think it would be even more
important in effect -- would you try out a software that does not even
have a tutorial? And don't forget, there are Windows users and
developers, too, who can't use an ncurses-based setup script.

Do you think it is worth to talk about our priorities concerning every
Hk-related task in a different thread?
