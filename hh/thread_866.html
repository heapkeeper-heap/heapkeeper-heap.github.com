<pre class="post-body-content">I noticed that the post items get "augmented" before they can be
printed. This means adding a default `print_fun` member to a copy of
the `PostItem` object, if the object doesn't have one.

Two questions:
- why copy the `PostItem` object?
- why alter the object instead of using `getattr` with the default
  value `Generator.print_postitem` whenever a post item is printed?

</span></span>
The reason is ugly, I have to admit.

We copy it because we don't want to change the PostItem object
returned by e.g. PostDB.walk_thread. PostDB.walk_thread stores the
'begin' PostItems, so it assumes that the post items it yield will not
change. Maybe walk_thread should copy the post items that it stores
and than augment_postitem will not have to copy it. I'll think about
this.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - why alter the object instead of using `getattr` with the default

</span></span>
Because it is nice that you can be sure that the post items have a
print_fun attribute. There are functions that wrap the post item's
original print_fun and create new print_funs based on this (e.g.
hkgen.Generator.{reverse_threads,enclose_posts,enclose_threads}. For
how to use them, see issue_tracker.Generator.enclose_issue_posts.). It
would not be nice if all those functions had to do this getattr-stuff.
These "post item modifier functions" should be as simple as possible,
because they are one of the main tools to customize generators.

Augmentation wouldn't really change it in any way relevant to
`PostDB.walk_thread`. But I still argue against the whole concept of
augmentation. My main problem is that it spends "real" CPU time (copying
and modifying objects) to achieve conceptual clarity (so that we can be
sure that the `PostItem`s have a `print_fun` attribute).

The users of the augmented post item can do whatever they want with
it. Maybe it will be useful to change its "level" attribute for some
HTML page.

</span></span>
OK, I understand your concerns, and I also think that the augmentation
is ugly.

There are two separate actions done by the augmentation:
1. Copying the post item
2. Adding the print_fun method to the post item

The ways we can deal with these are quite different.

== Copying the post item ==

I still think the best way to deal with this is what I described in
the my previous post:

<span class="raw-block">    walk_thread should copy the post items that it stores
    and than augment_postitem will not have to copy it.
</span>
This way we will minimize copying. We do need copying in that case,
because the caller of walk_thread can modify the post items. (As I
described above.)

== Adding the print_fun method to the post item ==

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I can still see alternatives to the current method:
&gt; - adding a getter function to Generator that defaults to
&gt;   `Generator.print_postitem`; then any "post item modifier functions"
&gt;   could use this function
</span></span>
Hm. Just for making sure that we are on the same page, the following
changes would be done for example to hkgen.Generator.enclose_posts.
(Which is not a post item modifier function, but I have just realized
that I don't have a post item modifier that actually uses print_fun,
they all use library functions like `enclose_posts` to deal with that
dirty part.)

<span class="raw-block">    def enclose_posts(self, class_, posts):
        """Returns a function that encloses the summaries of the given posts
        into the given HTML class.

        **Argument:**

        - `class_` (|HtmlText|)
        - `posts` (|PostSet|)

        **Returns:** |PostItemModifierFun|
        """

        def enclose(postitem):
            post = postitem.post
            if post in posts:
                heapid = post.heapid()
  -             old_print_fun = postitem.print_fun
  +             old_print_fun = self.get_print_fun(postitem)
                if postitem.pos == 'main':
                    postitem.print_fun = \
                        lambda postitem:\
                            self.enclose(
                                class_,
                                old_print_fun(postitem),
                                newlines=True,
                                comment=('post ', heapid),
                                closing_comment=True)
            return postitem
        return enclose
</span>
Generator.get_print_fun itself would be a trivial function.

I like this idea! Shall we open this thread as a ticket? (I would
estimate the effort to be "2"). You may implement it, but I am
happy to do it, as well.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; - adding a `__getattr__` method to `PostItem` that returns
&gt;   `Generator.print_postitem` whenever `print_fun` is read
</span></span>
This is not good because that would _always_ use
hkgen.Generator.print_postitem as the default printer function, while
in the current system if override MyGenerator.print_postitem, the
augmented postitems created (and augmented) in MyGenerator will have
MyGenerator.print_postitem as the default printer function. I think
the current behaviour is the desirable one.

OK, I will, but not tonight [1].

Yes, I considered this, too. I even imagined a way to set a
class-level attribute in PostItem to control which printer function to
default to, but I could feel this is a dead end. __getattr__ has
another serious flaw, but more on that a bit later...

<span class="meta-text">[note I did the following measurement before reading this post's
parent, so I'm glad we came to the same conclusion.]</span>

I wanted to measure the costs of augmentation. So I made this timing
test (a bit longer code section follows than what looks nice in an
e-mail or a post, but I felt it was easier to make my point like this):

<span class="raw-block">    import random
    import hkutils
    import math

    class Numop(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._num = random.uniform(0, 1000)

        def __getattr__(self, name):
            if name == 'do2':
                return self.do_sqrt
            raise AttributeError

        def do_with_default(self):
            do = getattr(self, 'do', self.do_sqrt)
            do()

        def do_sqrt(self):
            math.sqrt(self._num)

    print 'generating 1M objects...'
    numops = []
    for i in range(1000000):
        numops.append(Numop())

    print 'using defaulting getter method...'
    hkutils.int_time()
    for numop in numops:
        numop.do_with_default()
    hkutils.print_time()

    print 'using defaulting via __getattr__...'
    hkutils.int_time()
    for numop in numops:
        numop.do2()
    hkutils.print_time()

    print 'augmenting...'
    hkutils.int_time()
    for numop in numops:
        if not hasattr(numop, 'do'):
            numop.do = numop.do_sqrt
    hkutils.print_time()
    print 'using augmented objects...'
    for numop in numops:
        numop.do()
    hkutils.print_time()
</span>
This is pretty much self-explanatory, so I'll present the results
without further explanation:

<span class="raw-block">    $ python augmentation.py
    generating 1M objects...
    using defaulting getter method...
    5.350327
    using defaulting via __getattr__...
    3.331235
    augmenting...
    9.367637
    using augmented objects...
    1.580619
</span>
This means that the augmentating approach takes 9.37 + 1.58 = 10,95
seconds, and using __getattr__ would be the quickest.

But then I realized that having a __getattr__ slows down all other
approaches! So I commented it out, and did another run:

<span class="raw-block">    generating 1M objects...
    using defaulting getter method...
    3.285651
    augmenting...
    7.492890
    using augmented objects...
    1.375648
</span>
This means that a defaulting getter is the quickest, but there's no
real difference between an ordinary getter method and one implemented
as a __getattr__. But, as seen above, a __getattr__ slows a bit down
every access to the object, so I think a defaulting getter method is
the best solution also with respect to efficiency.
