<pre class="post-body-content">I did a major hk-dev-utils rewrite.

The main points are the following:
- More user-friendly scripts.
- More script in Python so that they are easier to improve.
- Python libraries so that the functionality is easier to reuse.
- Asynchronous post-commit hook that performs several check (unittest, pylint,
  etc.) and reports the result in a notification bubble and an editor window
  that is popped up.

I described the new system in detail in the README file. If something
does not work, please read the Debugging section in the README file.
The post-commit hook may even take more than one minute, but only at
the first time when the files of the git repository are not in the OS
cache, and I think only when you are cloning to a different filesystem
partition. (See the "Temporary directories" in the README.)

The post-commit hook is executed after each commit if you do an
interactive rebase. Since most current branches do have
pylint/whitespace/etc. errors, any interactive rebase of your branches
will pop up editor windows. This may be annoying, but this will stop
after releasing 0.8 (where we will have no test errors carried along
commits). I already created a branch (_commit-hook) in which I already
corrected every problem that the commit hook would find. So until the
current branches are merged, you can ignore those errors that were not
created by your current commit; but after the merge, every error
report shall indicate that either:
1. Your commit is not fine so you should correct it.
2. Someone left a problem in a previous commit and you are working on
   the top of that now. In this case the previous commit (whether it
   was yours or not) should be rewritten so that the post-commit hook
   will not raise any errors.
