<pre class="post-body-content">On points 2 and 3: at the current stage, we handle a lot of things via
customizations, and we enjoy it this way. But I think others would feel
like it's a hack, and not a serious project.

What it means in our case: if we want to offer a feature, we'll have to
provide a hardcoded way to make it possible. I think "your average system
administrator" lacks both the funding and the enthusiasm (read: funding)
to dig deep into the provided cookbook of interesting customization ideas
in order to implement what the bosses want. What these people need is a
complete and prepackaged feature that they can turn on with the addition
of a Boolean assignment at most.

I've never ever seen a mature product that you customize in the same
language that the product is written in. This is a powerful approach --
but might also strike others as a sign of inmaturity of the project.

However, I have the feeling that all of this will automatically come
closer with the advent of the web interface: if the web interface resides
and runs on a central server, it has to provide an out-of-the-box user
experience that appeals to most users, and then we'll no longer be
speaking about power users who we can trust with customizing the system
to their liking in Python.

But even if we go on to the Web interface, I want to retain the
interactive/local HTML option forever for the simple-minded hackers'
own heaps. All these months with the UMS Heap has amply proven that
the approach of static HTML generation, backed by truly distributed
Git versioning is a viable option.

I can even imagine the final form of our product will have the best
of both worlds: all the simple operations could be done from the web
interface, and when more complicated operations are needed, for example a
mass search&amp;replace, authorized administrators could log into the system
and do the work via hkshell.

<pre class="post-body-content">I mostly agree. However, I would like to clarify something.

I agree, if by hardcoded, you don't mean "hardcoded in hklib" or
"hardcoded in hkshell", but "hardcoded as a setting". We may have a
very flexible and customizable Heapkeeper -- with many customization
available in hkcustomlib, and a setting system that provides trivial
ways turn on and off and customize the features. I will send a
separate post about my proposal [1]. Both of us should be satisfied
with that: we will reach your aim, but without having to make hklib
ugly with a bunch of if-else constructs.

Sphinx is like that.
