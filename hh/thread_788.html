<pre class="post-body-content">You did a docstring update here:

<span class="raw-block">      @staticmethod
      def create_header(d):

 -        function to a str-&gt;(str | [str]) dictionary.

I think neither the old, nor the new ones are the best. I had to read
the source to understand what it does.

Warning: the function `copy_one` is jedi code. I was reading it while
watching TV -- it took about two hours to begin to understand what it
does, then I had to do experiments in Python, because I couldn't
believe that it does what it should. But it does -- the function is
thoroughly tested, breaking it makes 70 tests fail.

I would rewrite its docstring like this (of course later complete with
proper arguments and returns sections):

<span class="raw-block"> """Creates a dictionary of headers from the dictionary returned by the
 `parse_header` function. This dictionary contains only keys of
 existing header names, and if the source dictionary contains any other
 keys, an exception will be raised. Some headers can have an
 alternative name, which allows for parsing legacy post files.

 Two kinds of headers exist, one is which can have multiple values.
 The values for these keys are lists of string values both in the
 received and the returned dictionaries. Such are 'Tag' and 'Flag'
 headers.

 For the other headers, only a single value is accepted. It is received
 as a list with one string element in the source dictionary. If it has
 more than one element, an exception is raised.

 ** Example: ** ::

     &gt;&gt;&gt; Post.create_header({'Author':['Someone'],'Subject':['topic'],'Tag':['one','two']})
     {'Parent': '', 'Author': 'Someone', 'Flag': [], 'Tag': ['one',
 'two'], 'Date': '', 'Message-Id': '', 'Subject': 'topic'}
 """

Do you think this would be more helpful than the original?

You are right in that the docstring does not describe what the
function actually does.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Warning: the function `copy_one` is jedi code. I was reading it while

Which would be this:

<span class="raw-block">    **Argument:**

    - `d` ({str: [str]}) -- ...

    **Returns:** ({str: (str | [str])})
</span>
If you have a better name for `d`, I'm listening...

I hope you don't have a problem with the {key: value} and [items]
notation. I stole that from the Erlang documentation conventions.

</span></span></span>
Not true. A warning is printed in this case:

hklib.py, line 782:

<span class="raw-block">        # Adding additional keys to the _header and print warning about them
        for attr in d.keys():
            log('WARNING: Additional keys: "%s".' % d)
            copy_list(attr)
        return h
</span>
See commit 1932903 (Post: "forward compatible" post file parsing,
2009-08-27) for why we should not raise an exception in this case.

"one of which"?

&gt; 'two'], 'Date': '', 'Message-Id': '', 'Subject': 'topic'}
&gt; """
</span></span>
Having examples for these kinds of functions is very good, lately I
got used to writing them. (If we write a nice test case, basically we
get the example for free.)

Whitespace corrections:

<span class="raw-block">    **Example:** ::

        &gt;&gt;&gt; Post.create_header({'Author':['Someone'],
        ...                     'Subject':['topic'],
        ...                     'Tag':['one','two']})
        {'Parent': '', 'Author': 'Someone', 'Flag': [],
        'Tag': ['one', 'two'], 'Date': '', 'Message-Id': '',
        'Subject': 'topic'}
</span>
I think we can allow ourselves to put linebreaks into the output
dictionary in places that are convenient to the reader. Maybe we could
even introduce other white spaces:

<span class="raw-block">        &gt;&gt;&gt; Post.create_header({'Author':['Someone'],
        ...                     'Subject':['topic'],
        ...                     'Tag':['one','two']})
        {'Parent': '',
         'Author': 'Someone',
         'Flag': [],
         'Tag': ['one', 'two'],
         'Date': '',
         'Message-Id': '',
         'Subject': 'topic'}
</span>
What do you think?

Jedi code is OK -- it shows off our skills, it is educative to
understand, but it should always be adequately documented.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; I would rewrite its docstring like this (of course later complete with
&gt;&gt; proper arguments and returns sections):

</span></span>
Well, `dictionary_to_be_rewritten` would be too long, `old_dict` is
cryptic, so let's stay with `d` for now.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I hope you don't have a problem with the {key: value} and [items]
&gt; notation. I stole that from the Erlang documentation conventions.
</span></span>
It's perfectly OK with me.

</span></span>
Yes it is, thanks.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2"><span class="raw-block">&gt;&gt;  existing header names, and if the source dictionary contains any other

</span></span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; Not true. A warning is printed in this case:
</span></span>
Yes, but it was true at the point when this docstring was added :)

</span></span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; "one of which"?
</span></span>
Umm, a grammatical question. Let's simplify:

<span class="raw-block">    There are 10 kinds of people. One is which can read binary.
</span>
vs.

<span class="raw-block">    There are 10 kinds of people. One of which can read binary.
</span>
I think the latter form is better when the two sentences are run together:

<span class="raw-block">    There are 10 kinds of people, one of which can read binary.
</span>
This is only gut feeling, please don't ask me to explain it any
further, because I won't be able to. But this experiment shows that my
gut feeling is the same as yours: in this case, "one of which" would
be better.

&gt; got used to writing them. (If we write a nice test case, basically we

&gt;         'Date': '',
&gt;         'Message-Id': '',
&gt;         'Subject': 'topic'}
</span></span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; What do you think?
</span></span>
This will kill our naive KLOC values, but everything for the reader.

We could add a "non-naive" KLOC script to our scripts/ directory that
skips comments, docstrings and whitespace.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-2">&gt;&gt; Do you think this would be more helpful than the original?
</span></span><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt;
&gt; Definitely, thanks!
</span></span>
OK, I'll incorporate it into the set of docstring improvements I'm
planning to do in the next few days. Really!
