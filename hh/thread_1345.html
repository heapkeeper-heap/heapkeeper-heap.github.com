<pre class="post-body-content">I propose to modify the tutorial to propagate the usage of hkweb, and
contrast it with other forms of Heapkeeper usage (hkshell and direct
file system manipulation).

Have a look at the following table of contents. The words after the
colons are just explanations, not part of the TOC. I denoted the new
parts that are not present in our current tutorial with the word
"NEW".

- Downloading Heapkeeper
- Adding a new post to the heap: in this section, the user would
  create an empty heap and add a new post to it in several ways.
    - Creating an empty heap
    - From hkweb (Heapkeeper web interface) [NEW]
    - From hkshell (Heapkeeper console interface)
    - From the file system
- Editing the heap: in this section, the user would use an example
  heap provided by us, and would edit it in several ways.
    - Setting up Heapkeeper to use an existing heap [NEW]: We
      should create a tutorial directory that contains example
      heaps. The example heap used in this tutorial would be the
      same that it is used now; the difference is that now it is
      created as a part of the tutorial, and in the future the
      heap directory would just be copied.
    - From hkweb (Heapkeeper web interface) [NEW]
    - From hkshell (Heapkeeper console interface): This subsection
      would be basically the current "Modifying the heap with
      hkshell" section.
    - From the file system [NEW]: This subsection could contain a
      simple example that uses sed to do some substitutions, and
      then would show how the rl() command (that reload modified
      post files) should be used.
- Creating a heap for a mailing list
- Opening a real world heap: the Heapkeeper Heap

Work to be done:
- Writing new tutorial subsections and reorganize the tutorial.
- Creating an example heap. I think we could have an "examples"
  subdirectory in the Heapkeeper git repository that would contain
  the example heap. The strongest reason for including it in the
  repository is that is should be kept synchronized with the tutorial.
  The example heaps should contain dates. (The example heap in the
  tutorial does not contain dates.)
- Features that make it possible to add new posts to hkweb. This
  includes the "add child" feature [1], and we also need an "add root"
  feature.

<pre class="post-body-content">I have a new plan which is totally different from the proposed one.

We should have a Beginner Tutorial that deals with installation and
hkweb, and an Advanced Tutorial that deals with hkshell and the file
system. This is not new to Attis, since we have talked about this on
2010-10-16.
