<pre class="post-body-content">GitHub commit emails seem to be crazy, but I realized, what happened.
The same commits are present in multiple commit emails, and it is what
seems crazy at the first sight.

The reason of this "crazy" behaviour is that when we merge a
lot of changes into a thread (like the changes of "threads" into
"master"), those changes will be included in the commit emails (no
matter they were emailed us before).

I think it is annoying, but there seems to be a reason behind this.
A commit email belongs to exactly one branch. All changes to a branch
are included in the emails that belong to that branch. This way, you
can easily emulate "subscribing" to only a few branches, and you will
see every changeset that goes into these exactly at the time they go
there. If someone had been interested only in our master, he/she would
have seen the improvements you implemented in the "threads" branch
only when you merged "threads" into "master" and pushed this merge, so
today at 11:18 (CEST).

I noticed that we only get mails on pushes to master. Is it possible
to get notification for all threads?

This is not true. We get emails on all pushes.
