<pre class="post-body-content">Today I set down to make the folding mechanism of hkweb more
efficient, because the "Hide all posts" and "Show all posts" were
quite slow on large number of messages.

The results were surprising for me. I thought that the reason of the
slowness was that I queried for `'post-body-container-' + postId`
(which I thought took O(n) time) for each post; so this way I thought
that it was O(n^2). Well, it turned out that building a dictionary to
make the query O(log(n)) did not help at all. Probably it is already
O(n), which means that the browser has its own dictionary or tag ids,
which is quite conceivable.

I worked on the search page of all hh messages [1] as the base for my
benchmarks. This page shows 1378 messages. It takes around 6 or 7
seconds to load it in both Chrome and Firefox. It takes 48 seconds to
hide all posts in Chrome (it takes 98 seconds in Firefox).

== Turning off JQuery animation ==

As I already said, building a dictionary did not help.

Then I removed the JQuery animations for the body hiding and for the
"Show body" button appearance:

<span class="raw-block">    -   button.animate({opacity: visibility}, 'fast');
    +   button.show();

    -   $('#post-body-container-' + postId).hide('fast');
    +   $('#post-body-container-' + postId).hide();
</span>
This took down the 48 seconds to 8 seconds in Chrome, and the 98
seconds to 2 seconds in Firefox!

== First versus rest ==

Then I made more experiments, and it turned out that the first
"Hide all" takes longer than the others. In Chrome, the first one is
8 seconds; the others are less then 1 second. In Firefox, the first one is
1.50 seconds; the others are 1.25 seconds.

The more interesting case is of course Chrome, where the difference is
much bigger. This 7 seconds do not appear at all if we use one JQuery
object to hide the boxes. For example the following loop will take 8
seconds the first time:

<span class="raw-block">    getPostIds().each(function(index) {
        $('#post-body-container-' + this).hide();
    });
</span>
On the other hand, the following look will take less then 1 second
even the first time, which is very strange, since it includes the
first one:

<span class="raw-block">    $('[id|=post-body-container]').hide();
    $('[id|=post-body-container]').show();
    getPostIds().each(function(index) {
        $('#post-body-container-' + this).hide();
    });
</span>
What is even more funny is that this takes 9 seconds:

<span class="raw-block">    $('[id|=post-body-show-button]').show();
</span>
while this takes less than 1 second:

<span class="raw-block">    $('[id|=post-body-show-button]').hide();
    $('[id|=post-body-show-button]').show();
</span>
but the most funny is that this takes 6 seconds:

<span class="raw-block">    $('[id|=post-body-container]').hide();
    $('[id|=post-body-show-button]').show();
</span>
I think some funny initialization is going on somewhere inside Chrome.

== Changes ==

I don't understand this data, but I acted upon it [3].

I changed the code to use one JQuery object to hide and show the
bodies, and to invoke a hide() on the "Show body" buttons on starting
up (because as the previous example shows, a hide() before the show()
will make the show() much faster...)

This way hiding and showing all posts is always less than 1 second in
Chrome.

[2] Actually, the load time seems to have changed from 7 seconds to
    6 seconds... but I guess that is just measurement error or some
    other funny effect.

We have 3 players: Chrome, jQuery and hkweb, and clearly hkweb is the
"good guy": it doesn't do any nondeterministic nastiness. Chrome's V8
engine does its nasty optimizations, and jQuery is made of 100% black
magic. So I think we can only do what you did: act on the absolutely
unintelligible and counterintuitive observations.
