    Yes, I like Asimov, too.

I think `[...]` should be a special bracket segment. I don't know
though what we should do with it. Maybe it could be converted to
simple text for now. Afterwards (with a slightly backward incompatible
solution) we may introduce another behaviour, e.g. it could link to
the original paragraph. (We could have a setting about turning off the
new behaviour.)

</span></span>I like this idea. We could even extend it to merge a stream of replies
into a single page, to simulate "in-place replies". An example:

A writes:

    We could create a meta to include images in a post. Not that I'd
    particularly love to see such a feature in Hk, but who knows,
    maybe there'll be people who absolutely need this feature.

B replies:

    &gt; We could create a meta to include images in a post.

    A good idea. Though I'd probably never use it myself, it's
    unreasonable to lose potential users because a feature is missing
    that'd be trivial to implement.

A replies to B's reply:

    &gt; it's
    &gt; unreasonable to lose potential users because a feature is missing
    &gt; that'd be trivial to implement.

    Very good point.

When viewing thread with "in-place replies" enabled:

    We could create a meta to include images in a post. Not that I'd
    particularly love to see such a feature in Hk, but who knows,
    maybe there'll be people who absolutely need this feature.

        A good idea. Though I'd probably never use it myself, it's
        unreasonable to lose potential users because a feature is missing
        that'd be trivial to implement.

            Very good point.

What do you think? In my opinion, making sense of long
reply-to-reply-to-reply threads would be _way_ more legible.

<pre class="postbody">== Wave ==

When I first read your email, I thought you were going to suggest
this:

   We could create a meta to include images in a post.

       A good idea. Though I'd probably never use it myself, it's
       unreasonable to lose potential users because a feature is missing
       that'd be trivial to implement.

           Very good point.

   Not that I'd particularly love to see such a feature in Hk, but
   who knows, maybe there'll be people who absolutely need this
   feature.

Which reminds me to Google Wave, because that can do it, too.
(Of course Wave does not automatically merge existing emails, but the
users have to click to the appropriate place and write their answer
there to make this happen.)

== Attis ==

As far as I see, your suggestion just copies the posts' bodies after
each other without quotes, and indents them. If we look at our index
page, it is basically just having the post's body in nothing else in
the post summary. Or if we look at the thread page, it is just having
the posts indented. Plus removing the quotes.

I think your suggestion is much easier to implement than the Wave-like
idea, and I like it. We have two functionality out of the three that
you suggest:
- post bodies after each other are present in the thread page
- indentation is present in the index page
- quote hiding is not implemented

I think we previously talked about inline posts in general. It would
mean that the index page generator would have an additional parameter:
the list of inline posts, i.e. the posts which should have their body
shown in the index page. The current thread view would be a special
case, where the posts are flat. Your current suggestion would be
another special case, where the posts are not flat, and the quotes are
removed from the body.

A feature that I would like soon is the custom post summaries: it
would mean that a function is a parameter of the index generation, and
this function decides what summary to print for a post. This feature
would automatically make the "general inline posts" feature happen,
together with removing the comment from the body. So if we implement
this, which should be easy, we just have to write a small
customization function to implement your suggestion.
