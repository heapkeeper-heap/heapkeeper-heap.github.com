<pre class="post-body-content">Since we separated the UMS heap and the Heapkeeper Heap, I often want
to reply to a HH post that is not present in the mailing list behind
HH, only on HH.  This could also occur in cases when the post does not
even have an email counterpart because it was originally created in
the heap.

I propose that the reply post should be created in one of the
following ways.

== Without GMail web interface ==

If you can use an email client other than GMail web interface, and the
parent is an email in our inbox, choose this method.

1. Reply to the parent email and remove the "[hh]" part from the
   subject. This way the new email will be recognized by other mail
   clients (except for GMail web interface) and by Heapkeeper as a
   children of the parent email (because the sender email client will
   put the message id of the parent email into the In-Reply-To field
   of the email header of the new email).

2. Put a reference into the email that refers to the HH GitHub page of
   the parent post, e.g.:

<span class="raw-block">       [note Parent post: http://heapkeeper-heap.github.com/hh/thread_12340.html#post-summary-hh-12345]

   This way it will be easy for the reader of the mailing list to have
   a look at the parent and the thread.
</span>
Point (2) means that we have to support this link format of the
generated thread pages forever, but I don't have a problem with that.
Maybe we will regard it as a legacy format some day; then we can have
an option to turn it on.

== With GMail web interface ==

Since the subject has to be changed (the "[hh]" part has to be
removed), GMail web interface will not put the message id of the
parent email into the In-Reply-To field of the header of the new
email. This means that the new post has to be joined with the parent
in the heap by a heap maintainer, so a "todo" tag should be used as
well:

<span class="raw-block">   [todo Parent: heap://12345]
</span>
== Summary ==

Do the followings when replying to a post not present on HH:

1. Change the subject by removing the "hh" tag.

2. If you use a non-web-GMail interface and reply to the parent email,
   append this to the email:

<span class="raw-block">       [note Parent post: http://heapkeeper-heap.github.com/hh/thread_12340.html#post-summary-hh-12345]

   otherwise add this:

       [note Parent post: http://heapkeeper-heap.github.com/hh/thread_12340.html#post-summary-hh-12345]
       [todo Parent: heap://12345]
</span>
This method (point 1 only if necessary) could be the preferred method
for any heap, not only for HH.
