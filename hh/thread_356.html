<pre class="postbody">We have been writing a `[wiki]` bracket segment in the posts that has
wiki syntax.

But what is wiki syntax? We want to handle itemization, raw blocks,
inline raw text, quotes, citations, etc. anyway. I think the only
thing we included in wiki and excluded from normal posts are the wiki
headers. But why not include them in normal posts? It is highly
unlikely that people start a normal line with `==` by accident, and it
is so unnecessary to write the `[wiki]` bracket segment all the time.

</span></span>Very tempting. And even if a "==" breaks to the beginning of the line
(e.g. in an inline piece of code), it would only make it a wiki header
if the line also ended with "==", which is highly unlikely. Other than
that, I can't think of a situation where this can get dangerous. So I
say OK.
