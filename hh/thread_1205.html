<pre class="post-body-content">Issue trackers I know usually have a "main view" where you can browse
the list of all issues in a table with one row per line. If you click
or otherwise select an issue, you see its details in another view.

This model could be implemented in our issue tracker using table-based
sections. I think this would improve the usability of the issue
tracker.
