<pre class="post-body-content">I'm happy to announce that Heapkeeper v0.8 has been released.

The main improvements of this release are hkweb features: better search,
faster post body folding, possibility to use authentication and add new
child posts.

Major new features:
- New child posts can be added in hkweb.
- hkweb supports authenticating users.
- The search bar in hkweb can contain new target types: the user can
  search for posts with certain tags, posts after/before a certain date,
  posts on a certain heap, etc; and all these can be negated and
  combined. The "Issue Tracker" plugin even adds an "issue" target type.
- The search page shows the number of hits and has better unicode
  handling.
- The "Chat" plugin implements real-time chat (instant messaging) in
  hkweb.
- The "Users" plugin displays users' recent activity on hkweb pages.
- The "Custom Heap Server" plugin can be started for all heaps.

Major refactorings:
- Folding of post bodies is hkweb is 50 times faster.

Other major improvements:
- hk-dev-utils can perform automatic tests on Heapkeeper in a more
  convenient way than before.
- test.py collects test modules dynamically (they used to be hardcoded).

Major deprecation:
- Post item augmentation is no longer supported. It became unnecessary
  due to refactoring: if a post item is created, it does not need to be
  augmented any more.
- Post pages are deprecated. (Use thread pages instead.)
- Old configuration formats are deprecated. (Use the new format
  instead.)
