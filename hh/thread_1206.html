<pre class="post-body-content">I'm happy to announce that Heapkeeper v0.5 has been released.

The main improvement of this release is supporting several heaps.

Major new features:

- Heapkeeper now supports several heaps.
- The term "heapid" was abandoned as the identifiers of posts. The new terms
  are: post index, heap id, and post id.

The new release can be downloaded from <a href="http://heapkeeper.org/download.html">http://heapkeeper.org/download.html</a>
