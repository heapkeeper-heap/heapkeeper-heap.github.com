<pre class="postbody">Attis,

you seem to have ignored my corrections on the _star-flat-bugfix
branch. You cherry-picked your "hklib: stars in flat sections bug
fixed" commit onto the _hcs branch, creating the branch _has_tags, but
you have not squashed my "Correction" commit into it.

<pre class="postbody">Thanks for the warning. In fact, I didn't want to include anything
about the flat sections bug in that bug -- it seems like I based it
off the wrong commit, or made a mistake during rebasing. I'll fix that
now.
