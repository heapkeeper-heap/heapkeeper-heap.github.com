<pre class="post-body-content">As of now, the repository contains 4 branches which are stuck at an
earlier phase. I want to bring these up to the current master, so that
they have a chance to be included in the next release (0.7).

The affected branches:
- _hkrc_attis: stuck just before 0.4. It contains several improvements
  I want to use in my heap maintaining work, plus it's simple code
  I'll begin with this.
- _blog: this is stuck just after 0.4. I'd like to use this to power a
  personal blog, so I'll bring it up-to-date.
- _imap: I think this is the most important to be included in the next
  release. It is needed to use Hk reliably on IMAP servers which are
  more limited than Google's; it still needs some attention.
- _issue_tracker: this branch needs the most attention; I embarked on
  a venture to make the issue tracker more beautiful, but it can't be
  included in a release like this -- it hotlinks to Canonical's forum
  icons, which is not a nice thing to do (and even worse to deploy!)
