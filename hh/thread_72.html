<pre class="postbody">I made some minor modifications, partly to my heapcustom, partly in a
local branch. Their aim is to overcome the greatest obstacle to
reading the Heap on a PDA, namely, too large index HTMLs. First, I
modified the already present monthly sectioning in my heapcustom to
add a separate index for every month. Then, I added a feature to
include an arbitrary HTML header in the index HTML. I use this
mechanism then to add a "Previous month" and a "Next month" link to
the top of each monthly index.

With this, I have indices of a more manageable size. Right now, I use
only a single section in these monthly indices, but, of course, these
can be arbitrarily sectioned just as the main index is.

However, I have the gut feeling that this mechanism lacks the
completeness, elegance or both to be the perfect solution for the
problem of oversized indices on PDAs. Any other ideas?

</span></span>I guess the problem is that the size of post summaries of one month just happens
to be around the managable size, and if it wasn't (in another heap
maybe it won't), then this solution is not the best.

A few ideas; I haven't really thought about which one is easy to implement:
- Using the classic method to display a lost of messages: one HTML
page contains only a fixed number of messages, and the user can use
the Next and Previous links to jump between them. The problem is, do
we want to break the threads?
- This idea is a kind of solution to the problem arosen by the
previous one. We could print only one line to represent a thread in
the index. That would decrease the size of an index dramatically. The
problem is that there are nested threads. By "nested thread" I mean
that at some point in the thread we changed the subject, and the
subthread whose root is the post with the modified subject is the
nested thread. Probably in this short index we want to display all the
different subjects in the thread, but we don't want to display any
subject twice.
- You could print "..." at the end of long subjects. This is easy, but
first we have to implement printing the subject via a subject_fun
(just as we print the date via a date_fun). If this is important for
you, I will set it to high priority.
- Can you run an apache web server on your PDA? We could use apache to
run the web interface; maybe first only or displaying the content of
the mail database. I feel more and more when I listen to your needs
that instead of improving the static HTML we should generate the
content dynamically, which would make us much freer.
