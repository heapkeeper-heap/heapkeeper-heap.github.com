<pre class="post-body-content">When I first tested downloading (`dl()`) in the current _v0.5 branch
(8dee3e5), its behavior was not what I would have expected.
I launch Hk and issued a `dl()` command after specifying several heaps
in the config file. This is what I got:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Posts cannot be downloaded: no heap specified.
</span>
My first reaction was something like "OK, I haven't specified which
heap to download; then why not download all of them?" But now that
I've thought about it for a while, maybe this is what should happen,
but the message could be made more helpful. How about this?

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    No default heap specified. Select a heap using 'sh()'.
</span>
It is a special case when there is only a single heap specified in the
config file. The software's ability to handle multiple heaps should
not hinder those users who don't need it. This could be accomplished
most easily by examining if there's only one heap, and if yes, make it
default.

I don't really like the term "heap id hint". Why not call it "default
heap" or "current heap"? I think it is quite similar to the well-known
"current directory" concept of modern operating systems.

You are right. I have fixed this. See branch _hh/1203.

You are right. Let's call it the "default heap". See branch _hh/1203.
