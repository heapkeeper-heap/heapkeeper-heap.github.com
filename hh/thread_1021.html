<pre class="post-body-content">Now I feel just like Susan Calvin with the mind-reading robot...

We've been dreaming about automatic reloading of changed modules in
Python for some time now [1][2], but to my surprise, it seems to have
come true, and I don't know how!

I've been examining a bug in my hkrc related to hkweb, and I noticed
that I don't have to restart Hk for my changes in hkrc to take effect!
I'll try to present a reproducible case here.

First, check out `_hkweb` (07b992c as of 2010-01-10). Launch Hk with
`hkrc.py` being a symlink to `hkrc_attis.py`. Now navigate to
`<a href="http://localhost:8080/`">http://localhost:8080/`</a> . OK, you see my tidying index, with one
section called 'Takar√≠tani', Hungarian for tidying. Now open
`hkrc_attis.py`, and go to line 101, where this string can be found.
Change it to 'Tidying' and save. Now reload the page in your browser.
And behold, the title has changed!

Some clues to what may be happening can be found in the terminal. When
a page is requested, and `hkrc.py` has changed, this message can be
seen:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; Feature already set.
    Web service started.
    <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8080/">http://0.0.0.0:8080/</a>
    Exception in thread Thread-13:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/threading.py", line 486, in __bootstrap_inner
        self.run()
      File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hkweb.py", line 100, in run
        WebApp.run()

</span>
So it seems like hkrc.py is loaded again! To confirm, I add a `print`
statement just before calling `main()`, and save. And when reloading,
I see this output:

<span class="raw-block">    Hello from hkrc, about to call main.
    Feature already set.
    http://0.0.0.0:8080/
    Exception in thread Thread-14:
    ...
</span>
So hkrc.py is reloaded! But how? I checked in `hkweb.py`, and I can't
seem to find any trace of this.

An idea: let's raise an exception instead of that `print` statement.
Maybe the stack trace will be useful.

And indeed it is. See:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/web.py-0.32-py2.5.egg/web/application.py",
line 240, in process
        return p(lambda: process(processors))
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/web.py-0.32-py2.5.egg/web/application.py",
line 557, in processor
        h()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/web.py-0.32-py2.5.egg/web/application.py",
line 646, in __call__
        self.check(mod)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/web.py-0.32-py2.5.egg/web/application.py",
line 660, in check
        reload(mod)
      File "/data/lab/hk/heapkeeper/hkrc.py", line 286, in &lt;module&gt;
        raise Exception
    Exception

So web.py does it for us. I wonder how they handle those problems
we've discussed related to objects, namely that on reloading modules,
objects retain their membership to the old versions of the classes.

Are you sure it handles those?

No, I'm almost sure it doesn't. But I haven't checked.
