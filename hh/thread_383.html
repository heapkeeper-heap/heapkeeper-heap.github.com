+        if thread_link is not None:

So far I have always written "thread_link != None" in these
situations. But a few days ago I read that "is not None" is the
convetion most Python programmers follow.

Do you agree to use "is not None" from now on? I guess we should also
replace the existing "!= None"-s with "is not None".

</span></span>I prefer to keep my code as readable as possible. I have the
impression that even if we like to think that we are quite fluent in
programming languages, a piece of code is most comprehensible if it is
as close to English as possible (or maybe it's just me and Python...)

But even if I know no Python, this:

    if recipient is None:

is still easily understood.

That's why I use it. Now that you propose it, I of course say OK.

As a side note, I googled a bit to find out if there is any semantic
difference between '==' and 'is' in this case. I found this noteworthy
piece:
