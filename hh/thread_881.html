Your solution is beautifully simple, but I want to check if the results
are consistent with our expectations. I want to list some possible
scenarios and check if this solution handles them correctly. Later,
this list could be used in test cases for the issue tracker.

== #1: Proposal and agreement on straight line ==

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
    Let's agree that we do X.

      &lt;2&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
      OK.

        &lt;3&gt; Csabi New convention \[prop\]
        \[close\]
</span>
Openness table:

<span class="raw-block">    1   1
    2   1
    3   0
</span>
This scenario is handled as expected.

== #2: Opening in thread and agreement on straight line ==

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Attis Strange behavior when X -- intended? \[discussion\]
    Hk behaves strangely when I do X. Is this a bug, or is this
    intended?

      &lt;2&gt; Csabi Bug in X \[bug\]
      It is a bug.
      \[open\]

        &lt;3&gt; Attis Bug in X \[bug\]
        I've pushed a bugfix to the branch _x-bugfix.

          &lt;2&gt; Csabi Bug in X \[bug\]
          Thanks.
          \[close\]
</span>
Openness table:

<span class="raw-block">    1   0
    2   1
    3   1
    4   0
</span>
This scenario is handled as expected.

== #3: Proposal and agreement with side branch ==

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
    Let's agree that we do X.

      &lt;2&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
      Do you think Y should be considered?

        &lt;3&gt; Csabi New convention \[prop\]
        Y is totally unrelated to X.

          &lt;4&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
          I see.

        &lt;5&gt; Attis New convention \[prop\]
        I agree to X.

          &lt;6&gt; Csabi New convention \[prop\]
          \[close\]
</span>
Note: in this case, it would be more logical to modify &lt;4&gt;'s parent to
&lt;1&gt; instead of &lt;2&gt;.

Openness table:

<span class="raw-block">    1   1
    2   1
    3   1
    4   1
    5   1
    6   0
</span>
This scenario is handled as expected.

== #4: One issue split and one part resolved ==

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Attis Bug found \[bug\]
    Doing X causes errors during index generation.
    \[open\]

      &lt;2&gt; Attis Double bug! \[bug\]
      I discovered that the errors are a result of two discinct bugs,
      A and B.

        &lt;3&gt; Attis Bug A \[bug\]
        Bug A affects module M.

          &lt;4&gt; Csabi Bug A: suggestion \[bug\]
          You should correct this bug by doing 1.

            &lt;5&gt; Csabi Bug A: solution \[bug\]
            I have pushed a bugfix.

              &lt;6&gt; Attis Bug A: solution \[bug\]
              Thanks!
              \[close\]

        &lt;7&gt; Attis Bug B \[bug\]
        Bug A affects module N.
</span>
Openness table:

<span class="raw-block">    1   1

    3   1
    4   1
    5   1
    6   0
    7   0
</span>
This is not handled as expected. We should be extra careful when
splitting issues.

== #4: Proposal with "open" tag ==

A user who is not familiar with this algorithm may add an "open" tag
to a proposal, resulting in a double-open state that has to be closed
twice, like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Attis Important proposal \[prop\]
    We should improve X immediately.
    \[open\]

      &lt;2&gt; Csabi Important proposal \[bug\]
      I have improved X and pushed the changes.
      \[close\]
</span>
Openness table:

When you wrote this, you thought that "bug" was not a keyword, so
let's suppose the tag is not there.

In this case, the result is expected: someone opened an issue and
someone closed it. Then someone commented on it without reopening it.
If the author of post &lt;7&gt; wanted to reopen the ticket (or make it more
open if he composed it before receiving &lt;6&gt;), then he should have
write an "open" tag into it.

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;7&gt; Attis Bug B \[bug\]

    [open]

    Bug A _also_ affects module N.

The first algorithm disregarded the 'open' tag in the root post, and I
guess that's what you propose.

It's not difficult to do if we want it:

<span class="raw-block">        def is_thread_open(self, root):
            openness = 0
            if (root.has_tag('prop') or root.has_tag('issue') or
                root.has_tag('bug') or root.has_tag('feature')):
                openness += 1
            for post in self._postdb.postset(root).expf():
    -           if 'open' in post.meta_dict():
    +           if 'open' in post.meta_dict() and post != root:
                    openness += 1
                elif 'close' in post.meta_dict():
                    openness -= 1
            return openness &gt; 0
</span>
If that's your proposal, I support it because maybe some threads have
for example a 'problem' tag that's not handled as an issue, but later
we may qualify it as one. At that point if we used the current
behavior and added the new tag as an issue-tag, we would suddenly get
a lot of open issue (because the root posts of the 'problem' threads
contain [open] meta.)

== Multiple open/close in one ticket ==

We could have another discussion about having multiple open/close in
one post:

<span class="raw-block">     &lt;1&gt; Attis Bug found \[bug\]
     There is a bug: A

       &lt;2&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
       There is also bug B and C!
       [open]
       [open]

         &lt;3&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
         B solved.
         [close]

         &lt;4&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
         C also solved.
         [close]

       &lt;5&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
       There is also bug D!
       [open]

       &lt;6&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
       There is also bug E!
       [open]

         &lt;7&gt; Attis Triple bug! \[bug\]
         D and E was caused by the same things. Fixed now.
         [close]
         [close]
</span>
Or:

<span class="raw-block">     &lt;1&gt; Attis Double bug found \[bug\]
     Two bugs, possibly related: A, B
     [open]
     [open]
</span>
In this case, we should not disregard the [open] metas, but we should
disregard the "bug" tag! They are the same when only one "open" meta
is allowed, but they are different when we have more meta.

Does not seem to be sensible, but who knows:

<span class="raw-block">     &lt;1&gt; Attis Talking in himself\[bug\]
     Bug A and B found.
     [open]
     [open]
     And they also have been solved.
     [close]
     [close]
</span>
So if the root has any [open] or [close] metas, their tag is
irrelevant. If they have nothing, than the issue-tags are considered
as an implicit open tag.

I think it is a nice behavior that I described, but I have no
incentive now to implement it, I haven't seen any issue up until now
where it could have been useful. But one day it shall be done. Shall
we open a "feature"? :) (This thread could be the issue thread.)

Yes it is! Just today, I had two situations like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &lt;1&gt; Csabi [prop]
        I propose this.

        &lt;2&gt; Attis [prop]
            I like it, except that we should do...

            &lt;3&gt; Csabi [prop]
                You are right, but we have to modify Hk to behave as
                you propose.
                [close] # The proposal
                [open]  # The hk modification
</span>
The "close" and "open" metas would be there to clarify what is to be
done. They could have notes:

<span class="raw-block">            &lt;3&gt; Csabi [prop]
                You are right, but we have to modify Hk to behave as
                you propose.
                [close The proposal]
                [open Modifying Hk]
