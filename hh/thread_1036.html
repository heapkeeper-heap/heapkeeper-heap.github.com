</span></span>I don't think the repository would be for users. It is for other
developers. So I think we should keep the scripts that could be useful
to other developers, and only migrate those that are only valuable to
us.

Of the current set, `statistics` and `statistics.py` are the only ones
that are not concerned with our workflow. They could be kept if we
wanted to, but since they aren't maintained, we could just as well
remove them. (E.g. `statistics` calls `stat.py` instead of
`statistics.py`, so it wouldn't run as it is now.)

If we choose to remove the statistics script, my opinion is the same
as yours.

</span></span>OK, I modify my position then. The hk repository is for programmers
who want to play around with Heapkeeper, maybe modify a few bytes,
then maybe even send patches. I don't want them to be intimidated or
overwhelmed by the scripts that are very specific to our workflow and
working environment.

</span></span>I don't use them, so it is OK for me to remove them.

The statistics* files are a very good example of why I don't want
these scripts in these repositories. We will have more and more
scripts over time, which are created only for a very specific purpose,
will maybe thrown away, and are usually not well documented (although
this last part is not true for statistics*). They will just make it
harder for the programmers to dig into Hk. I don't expect them to care
about our workflow. I expect only serious Hk developers to care about
it. hk-dev-utils is for them.

</span></span>Well said.

I think what we need to be useful to others would be a cookbook with
many examples to handle a wide range of situations. It shouldn't be
hard: Hk is built to be customizable. Besides, it would be very
important to show how we can do what traditional mailing lists do. I
expect many potential users will be coming from that direction.
