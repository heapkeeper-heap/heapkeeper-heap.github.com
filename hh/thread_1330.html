<span class="container-button post-summary-button">Children:&nbsp;-</span>
<pre class="post-body-content">We should have an "add child" button next to each post in hkweb that
creates a child post.

== Implementation remarks ==

The `hkshell.enew` function does the same in hkshell, so most of its
code should be used here. Of course the best thing would be to
refactor the general part into e.g. a hklib function, and use that in
both hkshell.enew and hkweb.

== Add siblings ==

Attis mentioned in [1] that we could also have an "add sibling"
button:

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; A side note: we should add an "add sibling" function beside an "add
&gt; child". If "1" has another child, or more of them, which all come after
&gt; "2" in the thread view, after using "add new child" on post "1", the new
&gt; post will be placed after all of them, adding to the visual separation. If
&gt; we use "add sibling" on post "2", the program can be smart enough to
&gt; put the new post after the children of "2", and before any other child
&gt; of "1", with a probably much smaller visual separation between the old
&gt; and new post. (This function does not even need its own button: it
&gt; could be added to the button of "add child", but accessed while
&gt; pressing Shift; the availability of this function could be indicated
&gt; in mouseover text.)
</span></span>
Currently the siblings are sorted in a well-defined way: if both posts
have dates which are not equal, then the earlier post will be the
first to show; otherwise the one with the alphabetically smaller post
id will be the first to show. I think we should keep this ordering
when creating new posts in hkweb, which means that "add sibling"
functionality would always be equivalent to the "add child"
functionality of the parent. The new post would get the current
date&amp;time, which means that (unless there are posts from the future)
it would always be the last one among its siblings.

Although I have two notes to add:

=== Reordering ===

When the date of a post is modified, the posts are currently not
reordered so the order may become incorrect. It would be a fun
challenge to solve this by resorting the posts dynamically, but now we
just print an alert saying the following:

<span class="raw-block">    A major change was made on the post that may have affected the
    thread structure. To see the most current thread structure,
    please reload the page.
</span>
I think this behavior is fine for now.

=== Benefits and costs of the "add sibling" button ===

The "add sibling" button would be still useful in a way because the
user will not have to scroll to find the parent and its "add child"
button. But the cost of this button (occupied space next to each post)
outweighs the previously mentioned benefits. Although later we should
have a drop-down menu button next to each post that would contain the
less frequently used features, and that could include an "add sibling"
button.
