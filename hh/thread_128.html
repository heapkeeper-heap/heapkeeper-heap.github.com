</span></span>See commit efa4653435, 2009-04-27 19:59:22:

    ps_singles = postdb.roots()
    for post in postdb.all():
        ps_singles -= hklib.PostSet(postdb, [postdb.parent(post)])

This could have been written as something like:

    ps_singles = postdb.roots()
    for post in postdb.all():
        parent = postdb.parent(post)
        if parent is not None:
            ps_singles -= hklib.PostSet(postdb, [parent])

which I didn't like. I thought that an empty set is perfectly sensible, and it
should also make sense to create an empty PostSet. Then, the special case when
a post has no parents would not be special at all and needs no special
handling. After all, creating an empty set on a None input seems logical.

&gt;         ps_singles -= hklib.PostSet(postdb, [])

</span></span>You can write "postdb.postset(xx)" instead of "hklib.PostSet(postdb, xx)".

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; This could have been written as something like:
&gt;
&gt;     ps_singles = postdb.roots()
&gt;     for post in postdb.all():

&gt;         if parent is not None:
&gt;             ps_singles -= hklib.PostSet(postdb, [parent])

</span></span>This works without accepting None as a prepost in the constructor or
prepostset:

    ps_singles = postdb.roots()
    for post in postdb.all():
        ps_singles -= [postdb.parent(post)] # when postdb.parent(post)
                                            # is None, nothing happens

But that's what I would write, which is more efficient and nicer in my eyes:

    ps_singles = \
        postdb.postset(postdb.roots()). \
        collect(lambda post: postdb.children(post) == [])

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; I thought that an empty set is perfectly sensible, and it
&gt; should also make sense to create an empty PostSet.

</span></span>Yes, an empty PostSet is perfectly sensible. It can be created as
PostSet([]) or PostSet(set()). [] and set() are also good prepostsets.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; Then, the special case when a post has no parents would not be
&gt; special at all and needs no special handling. After all, creating an
&gt; empty set on a None input seems logical.

</span></span>It is not logical. It is only handy :)

Now the logic of prepostset is the following:
- There are preposts. Each prepost represents exactly one post.
- A prepostset is any of the followings:
  - a PostSet
  - a prepost
  - a set or list of preposts

With accepting None as a prepost, we would lose the principle that
"each prepost represents exactly one post"; or we would lose the
principle that a prepostset is a collection of preposts.

I'm hesitant to decide whether accepting None is handy enough to
give up these principles. Although I don't think it is handy at all in
your example, it may be handy at some other time, considering that
there are functions like `parent` that return either a Post or None.

should continue this effort.

</span></span>You should definately read the architecture page before doing so. There are a lot of information like this there.
