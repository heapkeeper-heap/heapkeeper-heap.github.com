<pre class="post-body-content">There is an idea that we or I had a long ago; I don't even remember
whether it has been discussed or not. Why don't we store post files of
HH on GitHub? I'm not sure whether it would be ugly or not (it
certainly would be unusual).

We have three possibilities:
a. Just don't do it.
b. Just do it.
c. Ask GitHub whether they have a problem with storing a mailing list
   archive as a repository on their server.

What do you think?

I thought we would communicate with our users and other developers via HH.

I understand that you wrote this to prove that we should not have any
concerns, but as I read it, and started to have some... I thought that
when using Hkweb, the central repository should always have the
up-to-date version of the heap -- that is, it should contain the posts
sent 3 minutes ago. Even without the Hkweb, we could have a server
that pushes new posts to the repository in real time. That's how
mailing lists work -- if you post something, it is in the web archive
a few minutes later.

What you describe is not that. You say that every post has to go to
GitHub via a heap maintainer. It is feasible for us for now -- but
what happens when we have a greater audience, who indeed would like to
have that always-up-to-date feature? We would need an automatic
mechanism for updating the heap (i.e. the repository) -- either with
Hkweb or with a separate program. Will we stop using GitHub as the
repository of our post files then?

To conclude:

The advantages of using GitHub (with human repository updates):
- We would not have to pull from each other's PC.
- Anybody could download HH any play around with it.
- Anybody could make an HH-clone, make modifications and we could pull
  from them.

Main disadvantage:
- If someone goes there, it will remain there forever.

I lean towards accepting GitHub as a temporary solution. With noting
that we will revisit the problem when we have Hkweb.

</span></span>
No, you've misunderstood me, though I can't really blame you for it. Of
course a mailing list exists to provide a means of communication among
developers and between developers and the users. But this communication
consists of either an interchange and discussion of plans regarding
the development, or questions and answers regarding the use of the
project. The result of both of these communication forms qualify as
documentation: they are either plans or howtos.

Again, misunderstanding. I wasn't advocating putting HH on GitHub, I was
voicing my concerns.

You definitely have a point there. But how about retaining the Git repository
behind Hkweb? How about providing a feature for editors to commit a known good
state to the repository?

On the Hungarian Wikipedia, a new revision patrolling system has been
instantiated. This is pretty similar to how I fancy using a Git repo as a
backend for the Web interface.

This discussion showed me how important it will be to clarify the data model
prior to moving on to the Hkweb stage.

I'm not that sure we'd have any need for HH until we reach at least some
maturity of Hkweb, and not so sure if we'll have it even after that.
Pessimistic, I know. But I'm not into marketing, and don't know how to make a
brilliant new project widely known. But, I think you have an excellent book on
that :) What does it say?

</span></span>
It says create a public mailing list and make all communication via
that. In our case, it is even more important to follow this advice
than in another project -- HH is our proof that our system is usable.

Relevant quotes:

<span class="raw-block">  "Communications Channels

  Visitors usually want to know how to reach the human beings involved
  with the project. Provide the addresses of mailing lists, chat
  rooms, and IRC channels, and any other forums where others involved
  with the software can be reached. Make it clear that you and the
  other authors of the project are subscribed to these mailing lists,
  so people see there's a way to give feedback that will reach the
  developers. Your presence on the lists does not imply a committment
  to answer all questions or implement all feature requests. In the
  long run, most users will probably never join the forums anyway, but
  they will be comforted to know that they could if they ever needed
  to.

  In the early stages of a project, there's no need to have separate
  user and developer forums. It's much better to have everyone
  involved with the software talking together, in one "room." Among
  early adopters, the distinction between developer and user is often
  fuzzy; to the extent that the distinction can be made, the ratio of
  developers to users is usually much higher in the early days of the
  project than later on. While you can't assume that every early
  adopter is a programmer who wants to hack on the software, you can
  assume that they are at least interested in following development
  discussions and in getting a sense of the project's direction." [1]

  "Mailing lists

  Mailing lists are the bread and butter of project communications.
  If a user is exposed to any forum besides the web pages, it is most
  likely to be one of the project's mailing lists. But before they
  experience the mailing list itself, they will experience the mailing
  list interface?that is, the mechanism by which they join ("subscribe
  to") the list. This brings us to Rule #1 of mailing lists:

    Don't try to manage mailing lists by hand -- get list management
    software." [2]
</span>
There is also a good section called "Avoid Private Discussions", but
that's too long to paste here [2], it is around one and a half pages.

Why not? It'd be very easy to set up a cron job on our server. We'd
have it run a download, and return the number of new posts. If this is
greater than 0, we'd do an automatic commit. These automatic d()-s
would be committed into a separate branch.

So this is how I imagine this would look at GitHub:

<span class="raw-block">                                                autodl

                                   attistidy

This, of course, could be rebased into a linear history.

Good to know, thanks!

It still seems Git black magic to me, but at least it can be done.

<span class="subject">Storing our post files on GitHub: opinions?</span>

<pre class="post-body-content"><span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; There is an idea that we or I had a long ago; I don't even remember
&gt; whether it has been discussed or not. Why don't we store post files of
&gt; HH on GitHub? I'm not sure whether it would be ugly or not (it
&gt; certainly would be unusual).
&gt;
&gt; We have three possibilities:
&gt; a. Just don't do it.
&gt; b. Just do it.
&gt; c. Ask GitHub whether they have a problem with storing a mailing list
&gt;    archive as a repository on their server.
&gt;
&gt; What do you think?
</span></span>
This thread has fallen silent quite a while ago, but I think the
question is still open.

If we had a GitHub repo for at least HH, it'd be much more comfortable
to clean up HH, and we wouldn't have to care about mailing bundles
around, which I'm not particularly fond of. HH is not sensitive
information; quite to the contrary, it's information that could be
useful to anyone who wants to make use of what we have developed.

It logically follows that for this to happen, we have to separate HH
from UMS first, which should happen very soon even if we decide not to
move HH to GitHub.
