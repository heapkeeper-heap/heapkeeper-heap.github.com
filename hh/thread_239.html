<pre class="post-body-content">This is a very long-term idea.

Many times it would be handy if the email I got from a heap contained
the heapid of that email. As far as I see there is one way to reach
this goal: by plugging in some part of Hk into the list management
software that manages the mailing list on which the heap is based.

This approach would solve another inconvenience: we would not need the
"IMAP user" whose account is subscribed to the mailing list and is
used to store the emails until they are downloaded by Hk.

And also a very important one.

What would we need for it? I think we'd have to weld Hk together with
an SMTP server.

If we can include this together with Hkweb, we'd have a marketable
product for sure.

I'm glad to hear that :)

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; What would we need for it? I think we'd have to weld Hk together

</span></span>
I thought rather using a complete mailing list management tool rather
than a simple SMTP server. Mailing list management programs have a lot
of other functionality that our users want to have: spam filtering,
archiving (maybe the users need the original archives),
member administration, banning users, subscribing and unsubscribing
people, etc. I don't want to reimplement all those features.

BTW, POSS has a section on mailing list management, that gave me the
idea.

Still, I'm starting to get excited by this idea. We should have a look
at our possible options. The first one would be firing up an SMTP server
from within Python, the second would be interaction with other mailing
list suites.

They should not be. That's the main reason why I'm hesitant about
giving decent support for moving emails between heaps.

The content of a heapid may change - but if someone bookmarked a post,
it should remain there forever. Just like a page on Wikipedia. It may
change a lot when you go back a year later - but it is still there.

This is a very important principle, which is very strongly advised
also in POSS. (He talks about mailing archives there, but a heap is
basically a mailing archive.)

That is just a result of the maintainers' behavior. They can do
whatever they want, even change heapids manually. So, if you bookmark
a post, you will have a link to the post to the same forever, but it
is possible that the maintainers decide to move that content that is
interesting to you to a new post. That's what I meant; not that we can
do anything about it.

We can link to a specific version of the post :) Something like
heap://893-3b4f6d3677c79b8f678a344ea28f65f69889b924.

OK, don't freak out, I'm just thinking loudly :D It is an awful idea.

Not at all. If we include some sort of integration of Git, this is
indeed possible.

<pre class="post-body-content">Yet another feature: post pages could have a "show the original" link
that would point to the email of the post (i.e. the original form of
the post [1]) in the mail archive.

This feature could be implemented inside Heapkeeper, but I think
people will trust the "real" mail archive more. Not without reason:
heap maintainers could of course manipulate the "original" post, even
if we don't give them hkshell commands for that.

[1] I'm not sure if I have mentioned this piece of terminology before.
    Email is an immutable object that has been sent by someone and is
    stored in mailboxes; post is a mutable object usually created from
    an email that can be modified and has a history like a wiki page.

I'm pretty sure no archive is ever tamper-proof. Even if it's stored on
IMAP, it's changed easily in a download-edit-delete-upload sequence. If
the user doesn't trust those with access to the server, it's all futile.

But if such concerns would arise, we could send back a receipt, containing
the MD5 of the original message. But of course, then the sender would
be able to wave a fake receipt, claiming that the message has been
altered. Further discussion would be in the domain of cryptography,
and I have next to absolutely no knowledge on such things. But I do
remember hearing about such situations from you. :)

A typical heap would have a much higher number of maintainers than
people who have direct access to the server. Although if maintainers
will be allowed to work only through Hkweb (for security reasons),
my concern would vanish.

Do you mean the situation when I thought I had created a very good
cryptographic algorithm that turned out to be very bad? Allegedly that
can easily happen to programmers who are not security experts.

I suggest continuing this discussion after implementing Hkweb...
