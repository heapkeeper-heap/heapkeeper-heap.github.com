<pre class="postbody">You have recently created several issues regarding performance
improvements. We had best not work blindly: we should use a profiler
to determine what is taking up time. Do you know of any such tool for
Python?

<pre class="postbody">I have used Hk on very limited hardware (a linux PDA), and it turned
out to be very slow. It was a critical moment of realizing how much we
rely on the power of our machines instead of optimizing our
algorithms.

So, I would like to use a profiler to find those nasty bottlenecks in
the code and make it run faster.

Another reason for this is that our heap is growing, but there are
just the two of us. I think we should take a real-life mailing list
(Python, Linux, Ubuntu, anything), and mirror it in Hk. We should have
a look at how our current implementation copes with a load of over 1M
messages, and what we could do to make it better.

I don't think this would be very important right now, or anytime
before releasing 0.4, but if we want to make Hk commercially or
community-wise successful, we'll have to consider performance in a
more real-life scenario sooner or later.

</span></span>I'm as well curious about the bottlenecks.

I had a few thoughts about optimization, but I described those in a
separate post. [1]
