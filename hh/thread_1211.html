<pre class="postbody">IMAP downloading currently works like this:
- get a list of all vaild message numbers,
- compile a list of message numbers above the lower limit
  (``lower_limit`` parameter),
- fetch the headers of all messages in this list,
- compile a list of all new messages,
- download all new messages in one command.

This has a serious flaw. Thus spoke RFC 2683:

	A client should limit the length of the command lines it generates to
	approximately 1000 octets (including all quoted strings but not
 	including literals).  If the client is unable to group things into
    ranges so that the command line is within that length, it should
    split the request into multiple commands.  The client should use
    literals instead of long quoted strings, in order to keep the command
    length down.

We are _way_ above this limit, and this is not good. Gmail has been
gracious so far to cooperate with our long commands, but not all IMAP
servers are so kind. I've been playing with Dovecot on localhost, and
I've received this error:

	error: FETCH command error: BAD ['Error in IMAP command FETCH: Too
long argument.']

The solution would be:
- assemble the list as we do now,
- in the first pass, remove individual IDs and replace with ranges
  whenever possible (e.g. remove all numbers from 1 to 1234, and add
  "1:1234"),
- then cut this to chunks that can be sent safely, and send them as
  individual commands,
- and finally, unify the results.

Since we do this twice, it may be nice to implement it as a separate function.

</span></span>We do this twice because we pass a list of message numbers to the
server twice: once when we query the Message-Ids only, then later when
we query the whole messages.

&gt; OK.

</span></span>I pushed a fix that works like this.

A note to the commit message: a situation when fragmenting the command
is needed might arise in case of a filesystem disaster. Suppose we
have a million messages in IMAP. Now if we do a dl(), we first send
FETCH a parameter of "ALL" -- not a long command. We find out that
there are 3 new messages; then we FETCH the full headers and bodies by
specifying them as "1000001:1000003". No need for fragmenting there.

But let's say that due to the FS crash, half of the post files are
lost randomly. Then a `dl()` first does a FETCH with "ALL", checks the
Message-IDs and finds out that the list of messages we want to
download looks like this: "1:3, 7:8, 10, 12:14 ..." and so on; this
would be a very long command which will surely break the downloading
process, as no server can be expected to accept this. So we need the
command fragmenting feature to be safe no matter what happens to the
mail directory.

<pre class="postbody">A side note: we've used this trick to get the raw Message-ID of an email:

    message_id = email.message_from_string(header)['Message-Id']

This was added on 2008-10-22, and we've been using this ever since
without problems. But I'm a bit concerned this may be a time bomb. We
use a facility built to parse complete and well-formed emails to parse
nothing more than a single header line. If we encounter odd warnings
or errors during downloads with later Python versions, this may be a
possible cause.
