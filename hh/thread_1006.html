There are a few older messages as well that contain this text:

Post.remove_google_stuff should be improved to remove this text as
well; and we should not forget to remove the boilerplate from the
posts that are already affected.

</span></span>How would you implement the filtering? Stupid Google, I thought that
pattern was there to identify this section to scripts, and they
scrapped it just like that. Now we have two choices:
- throw away everything below a `/^--$/` line (usually this denotes
  signatures, too)
- filter for the first few words, that is, throw away any six lines of
  which the 3rd starts with "You received this message", the 4th with
  "To post to this group" etc.

Which one would you prefer?

Also, is it possible to turn these lines off somehow in Google Groups? I
haven't found such a setting, though.

(Yes, there is one post that still contains that text and will remain
so -- the root of this thread :) )

</span></span>I'm not sure, and I'm not sure we want to turn this off e.g. for the
public mailing list under Hh. It is quite annoying on a mailing list
to get "How do I unsubscribe" email to the mailing list from time to
time. OK, that's not a problem now...

</span></span>Have you noticed that for a brief period, this footer was included as a
separate part of a multipart message? (This results in all posts showing
as if they had attachments.)

The first such post is on 2010-01-06. The last is on 2010-01-20.

The interesting fact is that all such posts are from Csabi. Do you
know what could have caused this? It would be nice to know more about
how Gmail and Google Groups work.

</span></span>Could you please mail me the original of an affected post as it is in

changed during transfer.) I'd like to try sending it directly through
SMTP to see if this strange behavior is still present.

Either I'm sending a post from the GMail web interface or from
Thunderbird, they later get into my "hh" or "ums" mail folder. So I
don't know which of my emails were sent from the GMail web interface
and from Thunderbird.
