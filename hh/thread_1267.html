<pre class="post-body-content">I created a plugin infrastructure for Heapkeeper.

== Rules and conventions ==

Each plugin shall be placed in the plugins/&lt;plugin name&gt; directory,
which the following directories:
- plugins/&lt;plugin name&gt;/src: Python source files (these directories
   will be included in the Python PATH so that the modules in them will
   be found when imported).
- plugins/&lt;plugin name&gt;/static: files that shall be served without
   modification through hkweb.

I have already created two plugins:
- The "Review" plugin adds a "Set to reviewed" button to each thread
   page. This button adds "reviewed" tag to all posts in the given
   thread and commits all modifications to the post database using git.
   The commit message will be generated from the subject of the root of
   the thread.
- The "Custom Heap Server" plugin is a parametrizable plugin that
   serves the index of the given heap on the given url. E.g. if the
   plugin is started with 'hh' as parameter, localhost:8080/hh will
   display only the posts in the Heapkeeper Heap, even if other heaps
   are loaded as well.

The plugin modules shall have a `hkp_` prefix (Heapkeeper plugin) in
order to decrease the possibility of a name collision.

== Starting plugins ==

An important concept is the following: plugins are turned off by
default and can be turned on individually by calling their `start`
functions. Some modules are not just on and off but may have several
instances; e.g. the "Custom Heap Server" plugin may have different
instances that serve different heaps on different URLs.

Starting the "Review" plugin:

<span class="raw-block">     &gt;&gt;&gt; import hkp_review
     &gt;&gt;&gt; hkp_review.start()
</span>
Starting the "Custom Heap Starting plugin":

<span class="raw-block">     &gt;&gt;&gt; import hkp_custom_heap_server
     &gt;&gt;&gt; hkp_custom_heap_server.start('hh')
     &gt;&gt;&gt; hkp_custom_heap_server.start('myotherheap')
</span>
== Final words ==

Everything is pushed to the _hkweb branch.

The issue tracker should be later converted to a plugin as well.
