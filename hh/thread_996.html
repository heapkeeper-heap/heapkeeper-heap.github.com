<pre class="postbody">I feel more and more certain that tagging's significance will be
shrunk if we implement a free-text search engine.

We use tagging for two situations:
1. We agreed on using some tags that are used intensively to create
   HTML pages and find our way in the heap: these tags include "hh",
   "issue", "prop", "reviewed"; and, to a lesser extent, "python",
   "git", "workflow", "timestat" etc.
2. Sometimes we use ad-hoc tagging: when writing about encfs, I
   thought about whether I should add a "linux" tag, a "unix" tag,
   both of them or neither of them.

This post is strictly about the second kind of tagging; the first one
has proven its usefulness. After we have implemented free-text search
[1], it does not seem important to me to continue to add these ad-hoc
tags. If you want to browse the linux or unix-related threads and
posts, you will search for "linux unix". Even if we kept ad-hoc
tagging, I would not trust it as much as search... so it does not make
sense to keep it.

What do you think?

</span></span>I think there's a problem here. You want to ignore adding either the "linux" or
"unix" tags to a post about encfs because you hope that a search on the words
"linux" or "unix" will turn up this post. But it will only happen if you
included these words in your post, which is not so evident. You could
well have written it without them, mentioning only "Ubuntu", or "on my
system" etc.

So I agree that ad-hoc tagging is redundant, but not because of
full-text searches. It is made superfluous because of keywords.

Three points in favor of ad-hoc tagging:
- tags are visible from the index and thread views, while the body,
  including any keywords or searchable content is not,
- tags are part of the e-mail subject, which means that they are
  "inherited" over to e-mail replies without paying extra attention to
  this,
- indices are (can be) still organized by tags; and full-text search
  is just not the same thing. If I write a post about something
  totally irrelevant, and mention a topic in a side-note or remark, I
  don't want the post to appear in the index for the side topic just
  because it contains a relevant word. Or if I talk about Monty Python
  and the Holy Grail, I don't want this post to appear among posts about
  Python programming.

</span></span>I'd like to keep it for now. I like to see the change of topics in a
thread, and for this, the tags are great.
