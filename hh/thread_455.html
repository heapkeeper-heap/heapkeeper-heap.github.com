When I showed the Heapkeeper web site to a friend of mine, he looked
at it by clicking on the "next" button a few times. So I think it is
useful if hitting that button gives the visitor the best sequence of
Heapkeeper pages. I tried to make it happen, it is in the repository.
I also removed the "Heapkeeper" title from the index (not index-main).

As it is the second stop on the "guided tour", we desperately need
screenshots. What do you think these should be based on? Imagined
examples (like the robot example), or screenshots of our heap?

I think we should also separate hh from ums by the time 0.3 is launched.

The one based on the repo looks the same. Are they supposed to be in
the doc/images directory?

</span></span>What we can do is set up a Google Group for HH. That could be done by
0.3, it takes only a few minutes.

But I don't think we should separate the two heaps (i.e. post files
and git repositories) yet. We don't have the infrastructure for that.
That should be an aim for 0.4. I have already ideas about how to do
that, and it will be easier than I first thought. (I'm just lazy to
write emails about it upfront.)
