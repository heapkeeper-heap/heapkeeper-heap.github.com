<pre class="post-body-content">== Introduction ==

In a previous thread we talked about the need of having a simpler
customization system that does not require the user to know Python and
that enables everybody to turn customization settings on and off very
easily [1].

An immature version of this has already been implemented in hkshell [2].
Please read the corresponding documentation to understand what I am
talking about now [3].

The current implementation calls the customization items "features."
I propose to improve the "feature" system. The word "feature" could
also be renamed to "setting". ("Option" is already used in a different
context.) Which name do you prefer? I will stick with "setting" for
now.

== Using the proposed setting system ==

The improved setting system could be used like this:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('gen_indices')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('date_timedelta', days=3)
</span>
Or we could have a hierarchical structure of settings as has
Thunderbird, so that it will be easier to understand the system of
settings:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('auto.gen_indices')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('gen.date.timedelta', days=3)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('gen.subject.same_as_parent')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('gen.subject.same_as_parent', symbol='&amp;dash;')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; off('gen.subject.same_as_parent')
</span>
We have a shorter version of all features now (e.g. on('gi') instead
of on('gen_indices')), but I'm not sure we need that. It would make
the system more complicated, both to implement and use. I don't think
we change the settings as much as we give commands, and usually
setting the settings will go into hkrc anyway.

Anyone will be able to make new features, as anyone can make new
commands and new event handlers as of now.

== Implementing the proposed setting system ==

=== hkshell.settings, value, state ===

I envision a global dictionary in hkshell called `settings`, which
contains the value and the state of all settings. The value of a
setting is known and seen by the user (e.g. "on" and "off"). The state
of a setting is an object that is interesting only for the setting
itself. E.g. when the gen_indices setting is on, a listener object is
placed in hkshell.listeners. (This listener object invokes the index
generator function at the appropriate moments.) This listener object
would be the state of the setting. The hkshell.settings dictionary
would store both, but the user would care only about the values and
not the states. By definition, the value is the part of the stored
things that is interesting for the user. This is what the users will
see when they ask the value of the setting, and this is what they have
to give when asking Heapkeeper to set a new value for the setting.

=== Setting functions ===

Every setting would have a function that can set the value of that
setting. The implementor of the setting would be helped by decorators.

A listener function is used now in the implementation of the
'gen_indices' feature. This function would be used unmodified in the
new implementation. The listener function:

<span class="raw-block">    def gen_indices_listener(e):  # `e` is an Event object.
        if (e.type == 'after' and # `e` was raised after the execution
                                  # of a command.
            len(modification_listener.touched_posts()) &gt; 0): # at
                                                             # least
                                                             # one
                                                             # post
                                                             # changed
            gen_indices() # generate index pages
</span>
The setting function would look like this:

<span class="raw-block">    @setting('auto.gen_indices')
    def setting_gen_indices(value, state, newvalue):
        # - value: the current value of the setting (as given by the
        #   user)
        # - state: the current state of the setting (as set by the
        #   previous invocation of this function)
        # - newvalue: the new value of the setting (as given by the
        #   user now)
        listener = state # our state is the reference to the listener
                         # function

        # Removing the listener if exists
        if listener != None:
            assert(value == 'on')
            remove_listener(listener)
            listener = None
        else:
            assert(value == 'off')

        # Adding the listener if the given new value is 'on'
        if newvalue == 'on':
            # gen_indices_listener is a function that I described
            # above
            listener = gen_indices_listener
            append_listener(listener)

        return listener # we return the new state
</span>
Usage:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('auto.gen_indices')
</span>
A more compact version:

<span class="raw-block">    @setting('auto.gen_indices')
    def setting_gen_indices(value, listener, newvalue):

        # Removing the listener if exists
        if listener != None:
            remove_listener(listener)
            listener = None

        # Adding the listener if the given new value is 'on'
        if newvalue == 'on':
            listener = gen_indices_listener
            append_listener(listener)

        return listener
</span>
The same scheme works for e.g. gen.date.timedelta and
gen.subject.same_as_parent. For those settings, I guess we need a
global hkshell.GeneratorOptions that is modified by the setting functions.

=== Deducing the name of the setting ==

We could deduce the name of the setting from the name of the function:

<span class="raw-block">    @setting()
    def setting__auto__gen_indices(value, listener, newvalue):
        ...
</span>
=== Default values for settings ===

The decorator could also have the default value as argument:

<span class="raw-block">    @setting('auto.gen_indices', default='on')
    def setting_gen_indices(value, listener, newvalue):
        ...
</span>
== Settings and options ==

You may ask: what is the difference between settings and options?
The shortest answer is that they are two abstraction levels, and
settings will be build on the top of options. When option x is set to
value y, the only thing that happens is that the dictionary of the
option object instance will have a different value for key y. On the
other hand, when a setting is changed, many things can happen: e.g.
all the current settings (like 'gen_indices') create an event handler
and insert it into hkshell.listeners when turned off. Another
difference is that options are local: they are just object instances
and many of them can exist at the same time. The setting system on the
other hand would be one global dictionary. This way, using settings
would be easier, but using options directly would be more flexible.

I can feel myself slipping into an old groove, but I cannot help but argue on
the various kinds of users, their expectations of us, and what we can expect of
them in turn.

First, we have developers, "one of us". They use whatever features we have,
since it's they who write it. As long as we have only these, everything is
fine.

Second, we could have (and should have sooner or later) "high power users".
These guys (or gals) don't themselves contribute to the code, but they are the
fine code warriors, who indeed Read The Flaming Manuscript (TM) before asking
any questions, and at the very same time (and this is our part in it) grasp the
essence and greatness of the project well enough to keep up with the
developers.

Third, if our project ever manages to get any attention at all, we
shall have "power users". For an ordinary project, the power user would
represent a high class in terms of competence, but for us, it'll probably be
the entry level, as it is very unlikely that your average Desktop Linux User
(under the pseudonym of Sudo Synaptic) will ever take attention in our project.
This group will most likely consist of poor system administrators, who have
been charged with the task of setting up a mailing list for some newly created
commitee at the firm. To make matters worse, it would have to be done overtime,
and, just as the poor fellow enumerates his options (Majordomo, Mailman et
al.), the Boss turns back to him, and adds almost casually "And it'd be great
if the archive could be edited.", meaning, of course, it _has_ to be editable.
This poor guy is looking for a solution that is as ready-to-run, off-the-self
and add-water-and-stir as possible, and the time he can devote to each of the
candidates is just enough for a quick download-install-try sequence. He'll
simply skip to the next candidate if he is asked to read anything longer than
your average README, and even that is pretty much the top of what can be
expected of him. No offense; that's just how it works.

So, as a conclusion: I'm all for hierarchical settings, but they are too long
for anyone not too deeply involved with the project to remember, and too
tiresome to look up all the time. We have to have a usable set of settings
available in abbreviated form at the power user's fingertips.

<pre class="post-body-content">I accept your point of view, although I don't agree. Since you seem to
have a stronger opinion that I do, let's have shortcuts for _some_
settings along with your wishes.

A side note though (you don't have to answer): Vim newbies often
complain that experts use the short names of commands on the mailing
list without explaining them. In our case they are the third category
of users: they will be intimidated by reading "on('gi')" on HH and
will be reluctant to look it up. Thus the setting shortcuts will help
only the first two categories of people. And not much: they can write
better shortcuts in their hkrc just as easily (e.g. "t()" instead of
"on('t'")). And as I noted, our settings are not like Vim settings
that are changed often while using Vim: they are like Thunderbird
settings that are changed once when you figure out whether you like
them or not.

I propose than that all setting should have a name in the hierarchical
structure, at least on the second level (a.b, a.b.c, a.b.c.d etc).
Shortcuts should be outside the hierarchical structure. E.g.:

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('etc.something')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; on('st')

</span></span>
I've just been convinced. It's not short options that'll help hands-on
administrators, but a sensible set of defaults that'll enable them to
deploy the system with the least amount of customization for the widest
range of purposes.

So, I can let go of the abbreviations.

You are right, still, Vim has its own abbreviations, and it's a
Good Thing. But how about letting the user bring their own set of
abbreviations? And providing a simple set of abbrevs for the most common
settings in hkcustomlib?

<span class="meta-text">[note I've written a lengthy argument on why I think it's important to
retain abbreviations for at least the most important options. I don't

Yes, I've also been feeling the need for a global instance of

Generally I say OK to this proposal, but with the addition of my argument for
