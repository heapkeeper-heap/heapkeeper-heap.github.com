<pre class="post-body-content">Sometimes it is hard to find a post you are looking for even with
grep, because the post just does not contains the word you want in the
form you want.

For example yesterday I was looking at the snmpget man page and
looking for how to set how many times it should retry a request, and
searched for "retry", with no results. I had to read through the
manual when it turned out it was written as "retries" in the text, in
plural.

(In GMail, it is even more annoying, because it searches only for
whole words, which is quite inconvenient is you are Hungarian.)

So we could have keywords in our email to make it easier to find them.
Tags are similar things, but more general. I will not add a "GMail",
"grep", "snmp", etc. tag to this post, which I may want to add these
keywords.

This could be a Hk feature but first it does not have to be. First
what about just writing them inside a meta: [keywords GMail grep snmp]
That way we could use grep to find them. Nobody has to write keywords,
it is only for making your own life easier when you think you will
look for this post in the future and you know that the keywords will
help you to find it.

<pre class="post-body-content">I had a very similar problem just this morning. I knew that I've
already written about how C++'s syntax is complicated to a point where
syntactical structures are almost colliding. This is pretty hard to
express, and even harder to find half a year after. I remember only
one thing: that it contained the Hungarian word for "to topple over"
[1]. I managed to find the thread using this [2].

I like the idea. Let's add a keywords meta.

[1] "borul"
[2] heap://ums/914

<pre class="post-body-content">If we write a post in Hungarian, should we add the keywords in
Hungarian? Probably yes. But today I was looking for an email, and I
wasn't sure about which language had it been written in. If you have
any idea to make this situation easier, I'm all ears.

<pre class="post-body-content">I second the problem, but the only solution I can think of is grepping
with keywords in both languages.
