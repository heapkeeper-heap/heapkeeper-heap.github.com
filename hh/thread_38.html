<pre class="postbody">== Sphinx ==

There is a tool called Sphinx [1] that generates HTML from docstrings.
It does a much nicer job than the standard docstring-&gt;HTML generator;
it is used for documenting Python itself since Python 2.6 [2].
I haven't tried it yet, but I like it. (I sat down for Python
programming, read a mail about documentation generators on the Python
mailing list, where someone recommended Sphinx; and I have been
reading its documentation, updating the comparison of the wikis,
writing this mail for more then 2 hours now... I wanna go to do some
programming now.)

The basic syntax is described here [3]. I updated the page on my
website that compares different wiki syntaxes [4]; and I sent the
content to the UMS heap so that you can "edit" and comment it.

The most important things:
- *italics*
- **bold**
- ``code``

Code embedding, shown in Python code:

    def f(smallfun):
    """Nice function.

    Try this:

        def sum(a, b):
            return a + b
        f(sum)

    You will see that...
    """

The "def sum..." lines will be verbatim syntax highlighted.

It uses the same engine (Pygment) for highlighting embedded code as
Wiko.

I like their definition of lists (note the explicit line numbering):

    * This is a bulleted list.
    * It has two items, the second
      item uses two lines.

    1. This is a numbered list.
    2. It has two items too.

    #. This is a numbered list.
    #. It has two items too.

It supports cross references: links to other pages or to Python
objects (e.g. classes, functions) [5]. E.g:

    See :class:`MyClass` for more informations.

== Docstrings and other documentation ==

I think we should definitely use Sphinx for our docstings.
I would even use that for normal documentation.

Pros:

- We could make links between them. Imagine this Developer Guide:

    :fun:`_recalc_cycles heapia.MailDB._recalc_cycles` starts out from
    the list of all posts, then eliminating all posts reachable via
    :fun:`iter_thread heapia.MailDB.iter_thread`.

  I agree it is less readable in the text, but it will be much easier
  to read in HTML, because you will be able to click on the function
  name and it will jump to the function's documentation. Of course we
  don't have to use this format if we don't want to, we can just write
  ``_recalc_cycles`` and ``iter_thread``.

- We will have the same format in the docstrings and docs.
    - The users and developers will have to learn only one format.
    - The users and developers will have to install only one tool.
    - It will be easy to just cut-paste if we wanted to move some
      documentation around.
    - Our documentation will have a consistent look-and-feel.
    - We don't have to maintain two systems, e.g. two sets of CSS
      files.

- It's a more popular tool. Probably it has a licence, and we don't
  have to care about it.

Cons:
- Your mediawiki Vim syntax file won't work. Of course I'll find or
  write a Vim syntax file for this; but I'm not gonna work with adding
  folding support. (You can do that, though.) Speaking of syntax
  files: imagine having the docstrings in the Python source code
  syntax highlighted with wiki syntax!

I know we made a deal the we will use Wiko, which you liked, and the
git commit message format that I liked. Here is a new deal (or New
Deal): we start the subjects with lowercase letters, and we use
Sphinx. What do you say?

== All the wikis ==

Just a tought: this wiki thing gets more and more complicated. Now we
have at least 4 different things where we want to use wiki syntax:
- documentation files
- documentation strings in Python code
- heap posts indented to be parsed by some wiki engine
- heap posts indented to be read only by humans

We decided to use Sphinx later.
