<pre class="postbody">I have a problem with the EDITOR environment variable.

In the _e branch I have a commit, which is not the perfect solution.

== Before ==

Before the commit, we just do this:

    subprocess.call(editor.split() + files)

This has a problem for example with this EDITOR variable:

    $ export EDITOR="gvim -c 'setf mail'"

Because `editor.split()` is this:

    ["gvim", "-c", "'setf", "mail'"]

So this is what we called if we had 2 files:

    subprocess.call(["gvim", "-c", "'setf", "mail'", file1, file2])

Btw, "git commit" has the same problem, it does not work with
EDITOR="gvim -c 'setf mail'". But I want Hk to handle this better,
git's incapability should not be an excuse.

== After ==

Now (after applying the commits of the _e branch) we do this instead:

    quoted_files = [ ("'%s'" % file) for file in files ]
    subprocess.call(editor + ' ' + ' '.join(files), shell=True)

Which handles the previous case correctly:

    subprocess.call("gvim -c 'setf mail' '" + file1 + "' '" + file2 + "'")

But it fails if a file contains a quote character. For example if
we have one file which is called "a'b", this will be the function
call:

    subprocess.call("gvim -c 'setf mail' 'a'b')

== Another solution ==

I came up with another solution:

    quoted_files = [ ("'%s'" % re.sub("'", "'\"'\"'", file))
                     for file in files ]
    subprocess.call(editor + ' ' + ' '.join(quoted_files), shell=True)

The trick it does is the easier to see using the a'b example. It
replaces every ' with '"'"', so for example it replaces a'b with
a'"'"'b. The list comprehension will put the file name between quotes,
so the whole file name of a'b will be expressed like this:

    'a'"'"'b'

Which expands nicely to "a'b".

I have two problems:
- Is it a proper solution? Can we expect this to work everywhere?
(Especially where not sh is the default shell.)
- Don't we have a better way to do this? Using double quote instead of
single quote and escaping a bunch of characters with backslash (i.e.
writing "a\'b") is not a better one, IMO.

</span></span>Maybe we should go with a modified version of this solution. We should
try to parse the content of the EDITOR variable. This way we will be
platform independent, and we can describe in the documentation how the
parsing is done. The parsing should be of course very similar to that
of bash.

<pre class="postbody">No! We should use only backslashes to state that "this space is not a
delimiter between arguments":

    $ export EDITOR='gvim -c "setf\ mail"'

or

    $ export EDITOR="gvim -c 'setf\\ mail'"

It would be much easier then to mess with single and double quotes.

</span></span>That's surprising! Somehow I'd have thought Git developers should have
