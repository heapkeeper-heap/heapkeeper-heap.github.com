<pre class="post-body-content">I rebased an earlier set of tidying modifications on our current head
of the repository. This contains posts with the obsolete "References:"
header. When the post database is loaded, this generates a series of
warnings.

However, when I want to tidy these posts up, I have to scroll back to
these warnings and type the IDs of the posts manually in order to edit
them, which is a boring and error-prone task.

It would be much nicer if the list of posts causing loading errors
would be retained in a list, so tidying up all the offensive posts
would be as simple as

<span class="raw-block">    &gt;&gt;&gt; e(import_error)
</span>
or something similar.

A possible improvement: instead of a list, we could have a dict that
would assign the offending posts to the names of the errors they
contain, so "import_error" would look like this:

<span class="raw-block">    {
        'unknown_header': [&lt;hh/123&gt;, &lt;hh/456&gt;],
        'encoding_error': [&lt;hh/789&gt;]
    }
</span>
Do you think this would be helpful? If yes, which form do you prefer?

Probably yes.

Although there is an easy workaround: copy-paste all warnings on the
terminal into an advanced editor, and with a few keystrokes you will
be able to make something like this:

<span class="raw-block">    e = ps([
        'hh/123',
        'hh/456',
        'hh/567',
    ])
</span>
which you can just paste into the terminal and got the list.

If you have so many error messages that copy-paste is not convenient,
you can of course do something like

<span class="raw-block">    python src/hk.py 'q()' 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;errors.txt
</span>
and edit errors.txt.

<span class="quote"><span class="quote-1">&gt; If yes, which form do you prefer?
</span></span>
The latter form. If we implement the former, I think we will soon want
to distinguish between the error types. Also, the above workaround
does not really work if we want to make this distinction; so the
desire to have this distinction is a good reason for implementing this
feature within Heapkeeper.
