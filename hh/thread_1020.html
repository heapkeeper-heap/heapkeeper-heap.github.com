<pre class="postbody">`dl()` is getting slower again:

The first `dl()` after about two weeks:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    Connected
    Checking...
    288 new messages found.
    Downloading...
    288 new messages downloaded.
    Mail database saved.
    dl: 54.979973 seconds.

Then another `dl()`, right after this one:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; dl()
    Reading settings...
    Connecting...
    Connected
    Checking...
    No new messages.
    dl: 50.394206 seconds.

This used to be much faster. Maybe Gmail's IMAP servers are getting
overloaded, or complex searches are throttled down. I think we'll soon
have to do another optimization of the IMAP code.
