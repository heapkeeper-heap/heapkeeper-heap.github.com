<pre class="post-body-content">== Advice ==

Here are some pieces of advice about how to write good tests.

=== Advice 1: don't duplicate ===

Try to write simple test cases. Try not to duplicate the functionality
of the normal code.

=== Advice 2: write concrete data ===

Try to write simple test cases. Test cases should not have too many
logic in them. Test cases should contain very concrete data.

=== Advice 3: don't test feature combinations ===

When testing several related features, first test what happens when
every feature is off, then test what happens when you turn on one.
This way we will have n+1 test cases for n features. If you have a
good reason to do so, you may also test what happens when several
features are turned on, but don' overdo this. We don't want to
maintain 25 test cases for all the different combinations of 5
features. Another advantage is that we will have a nice test code:

<span class="raw-block">    # testing when everything is off

    ...

    # testing feature A

    ...

    # testing feature B

    ...

    # testing feature C

    ...
</span>
Compare this with the following:

<span class="raw-block">    # testing when everything is off

    ...

    # testing feature A

    ...

    # testing feature B

    ...

    # testing feature C

    ...

    # testing feature A and B

    ...

    # testing feature B and C

    ...

    # testing feature A and C

    ...

    # testing feature A and B and C

    ...
</span>
I certainly don't want to maintain a code which resembles the second
snippet.

Again: there are some cases when you want to test all combinations of
the input (like test_hklib.test_exp), but those tests usually are not
about separate features, so there is no smarter way to test.

=== Advice 4: copy-paste is not a sin in the test code ===

In the normal code, copy-pasting code should be avoided as much as
possible, because it makes the code much harder to maintain. In the
test code, however, it is much more accepted to copy-paster code. The
reason is that test code should be easy to understand. Sometimes
people use it as an informal specification: a set of examples that
definitely work. Another reason is that it is much harder to extract
common test code into functions then to extract common normal code.
This is my personal experience.

== Counterexample ==

This has problems with the first three points I talked about.

Here is how the count feature is tested:

<span class="raw-block">  +        self.assertEquals(
  +            g.section(0, genopts),
  +            self.flat_result(g, genopts, [p(1), p(4)], True))
</span>
There is nothing concrete in here!

Instead of writing concrete data in the test case, Attis reimplemented
the feature in the test module:

<span class="raw-block">  +             Html.section_begin('section_0', 'Sec (%d)' % (len(posts),))) +
</span>
Finally, instead of having a separate test, all the previous tests
were copied, and one of the copies were combined with the new
features, which made the test case hard to comprehend.

== Note ==

When we started Hk, I didn't have much experience in writing test
cases. So there may be test cases in Hk which are not really good.
Especially in test_hklib.

Sometimes it is even sufficient to write two test cases: every feature
is turned off in the first one, and every feature is turned on in the
other one.
