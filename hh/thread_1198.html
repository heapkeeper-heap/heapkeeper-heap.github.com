<pre class="postbody">I wrote a Vim snippet that automatically updates copyright notices in
Heapkeeper source files:

    " UpdateMyCopyright:
    "   Automatically update copyright notice with current year
    " Based on:
    "   <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_Update_Copyright_Notice_in_Files">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_Update_Copyright_Notice_in_Files</a>
    function! UpdateMyCopyright()
        let myname = "Csaba Hoch"
        if &amp;modified
            exe "silent! g#".
                \ "\\cCopyright (C) " .
                \ "\\(" . strftime("%Y") . "\\)\\@![0-9]\\{4\\}" .
                \ "\\(-" . strftime("%Y") . "\\)\\@!\\(-[0-9]\\{4\\}\\)\\?" .
                \ " " . myname . "#" .
                \ "s#\\([0-9]\\{4\\}\\)\\(-[0-9]\\{4\\}\\)\\?#\\1-" .
strftime("%Y") . "#e"
        endif
    endfunction

    autocmd BufWritePre * call UpdateMyCopyright()

It makes the following substitutions:

    - Copyright (C) 2009 My Name
    + Copyright (C) 2009-2010 My Name

    - Copyright (C) 2008-2009 My Name
    + Copyright (C) 2008-2010 My Name

Don't forget to change the myname variable to your name. If there is no
copyright notice in the file or the file was not modified, nothing happens.

</span></span>I never really understood this. Why is it important to specify a year?
Or, even if it is important to specify a year, what is the meaning of
giving more than one? Is it used when deciding the expiration of the
copyright? Then only the latest date would be meaningful.

</span></span>Yes, I think that was the original concept. But there are also derivative
works, and the question arises: what date should you write into the copyright
notice of a derivative work?

The answer is (in the US at least) that you should write the date when the
derivative work was published [1][2]:

    If the work is a derivative work or a compilation incorporating previously
    published material, the year date of first publication of the derivative
    work or compilation is sufficient.

But how should we apply it to a source file? Is a newer version of a file the
same work as its previous version, or is it a derivative work? I don't know the
answer, and if we write both dates, we will be fine either way.

The Free Software Foundation goes even further: they say [3] that "it is best
to spell out each year, in full, without using ranges or abbreviations", like
in "Copyright 1998, 1999 Terry Jones".

I forgot about this and started using ranges today, an just remembered this
recommendation when I was composing this post. If you think we should follow
the FSF's recommendation, we can do so, but the ranges are OK for me.
