<pre class="post-body-content">Note: commit a42793b seems to be removed from the newest version of
the _auth branch, but I'm still sending this email (I'm curious what
happened).

Commit 2ebd16f [1] makes commit a42793b [2] unnecessary. 2ebd16f
solves the problem in a more generic way: it extracts the
functionality missing from IndexGenerator into WebGenerator (which is
the superclass of IndexGenerator) in order to avoid code duplication.

A bigger problem is that merging the attish/_auth and hcs42/_hkweb
branches have a conflict because of these commits. Modification of the
hkweb.IndexGenerator.__init___ function will not even show up as a
conflict, although it should be modified as part of the merge commit.

I see a few possible solutions if you need this commit (we may say
"bugfix") in your auth branch:

1. Cherry-picking 2ebd16f into _auth.
2. Merging 2ebd16f (and the prefix of _hkweb) into _auth.
3. Rebasing _auth to the 2ebd16f.

Fortunately it seems that (1) is feasible now, because 2ebd16f is not
dependent on any previous commit in the _hkweb branch, so I recommend
that. (2) is more general, and it avoids the redundancy of commits;
but it leads to less readable git history. If (1) was unfeasible, I
would choose (2). (3) is between the first two regarding the
readability of the git history, but I don't want our workflow to force
rebasing a whole branch in situations like this.
