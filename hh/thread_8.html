<pre class="postbody">The HTML files generated from indices, the HTML files generated from
threads, and HTML files generated from posts should be totally
independent from each other and any other generated HTML file.
This could be one of the Key Design Principles of Hk.

Hk would become complicated if we wired those kind of dependencies.

But I have another, stronger argument. Generating the HTML pages for
all posts takes 4 seconds now. It will be longer in the future, due to
generating real HTML with divs and everything (not just pseudo-HTML
with &lt;pre&gt; tags as now), the more flexible customization system, and
the larger number of posts. If we implemented the dependencies, that
would increase the generation time even more, and more importantly, it
would make it necessary to generate all posts all the time.

I plan to implement a system in hkshell, which would allow us to
regenerate the HTML files only for the posts that has been changed.
(Or whose thread has been changed, I'm not sure about that.)
Implementing this should be relatively easy, and it would save a lot of
time; but it would not be usable if we had index-post dependencies.

In web server version, I'm not against such dependencies; we will talk
about that in the future.
