<pre class="post-body-content">Attis and I had a meeting today.

We agreed on the following actions:

1. Solve the problem of paths: most importantly, the program should
   work independently of the current working directory. Beyond that,
   we aim to support two modes of operation: an installed mode, where
   the program and its belongings (e.g. CSS, JS files) reside in a
   central location, while config files reside under users' home
   directories, and a non-installed mode, which means the user just
   extracts Heapkeeper somewhere, and uses it from there, without
   separating the code from the user's data files. A possible
   solution: during initialization, we should check for a
   user-specific config directory (e.g. ~/.heapkeeper), and if it
   exists, look for config files there, otherwise look for them where
   the program resides.

2. Some function names, variable names and other identifiers in
   hkgen.py contain the word "link", but they actually mean "URL".
   These identifiers should be modify to contain the word "url".

3. Vim's gitcommit syntax highlight should be modified to use error
   colors when the commit message does not contain a commit topic.
   (Commit topic is an expression in the third line written between
   brackets that states the topic of the commit.)

4. Some buttons of hkweb ("Show", "Hide", maybe also "Back to index")
   should be moved to the hkgen, so that these buttons will be present
   in both the static HTML pages created by hkgen and the dynamic HTML
   pages created by hkweb.

5. We should create a @deprecated decorator for functions. It shall be
   placed in hkutils. It would make the decorated function print a
   warning when it is used the first time.

6. We should create a "Wikipage" plugin. The idea behind it is
   described in <a href="../hh/thread_4.html#post-summary-hh-4">heap://hh/4</a>.

7. The server that we use to store the git repository of the UMS Heap
   should perform the following actions in every 5 or 10 minutes:
   `dl()`, `s()`, `git commit`. If it works, we could do that even for
   the Heapkeeper Heap, which would also do a `g()` and a `git push`
   for both the Heapkeeper Heap post repository and the Heapkeeper
   Heap HTML repository (both of which are on GitHub).

8. hkweb could serve every request (except for the first one) without
   reloading the whole page. E.g. when the user clicks to another
   post, the new post could be loaded and the URL could be changed
   without loading the whole web page again. This would work like the
   normal GMail web interface.
