<pre class="postbody">Previously, attached files were simply ignored. But now there's been a
case when a mail with an attached message resulted in a malformed
post. The post contains the body and the attachment in encoded form
(quoted-printable and base64, respectively) complete with headers.

</span></span>That is not the case. Previously, there were no messages with attached
files, and that's why there were no problems! Now there are four of them
(2197, 2322, 2375 and 2441), and they are all in error. These are
manually corrected for now. Until this issue is resolved, please don't
send attached files.
