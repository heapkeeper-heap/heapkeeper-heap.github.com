</span></span>This is the change:

    -  **Yields:** |PostItem|
    +  **Returns:** iterable(|PostItem|)

This is my commit message for the change:

    This line:

       **Returns:** iterable(|PostItem|)

    is probably better than this line:

       **Yields:** |PostItem|

    It seems to be better to use "return" and "iterable" instead of a
    totally new conception.

I do understand "yield" but still think it is better if the
docstring says what the function returns and not what it yields.
Hk code often uses generators as objects: e.g. we create new
generators based on existing ones. For me it is easier to think about
these things if I think of the function as returning a generator
object, as opposed to thinking of the function as yielding something
at each call.

</span></span>OK, I can accept that.
