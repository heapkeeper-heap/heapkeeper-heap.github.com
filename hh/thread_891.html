<pre class="post-body-content">It seems to me that more and more often we find ourselves in the
situation that we talked about something on the heap but we can't find
it. We should do a cleanup. My proposal is that I will do the posts
that are Hk-related (with or without "hh" tag), and Attis will do the
rest.

Probably questions about conventions or concrete problems will arise.
(The first one: [1]) The questions about conventions should be posted
with "heap-conventions" tag to HH. If they are specifically about HH,
they should be posted with "hh-conventions" tag. If they are about a
specific set of posts and not about general rules that could be
applied in the future, they should be tagged with "meta". We could
also add the tag "cleanup" for all related threads.

What do you think?

I've continually been in such a cleanup for several months now, but it
seems that I'm always more glad to devote time to creating new posts
than to cleaning up existing ones.

That said, laziness is not the only thing that holds back this task.
Sometimes, it's pretty hard. You have to make difficult choices, often
made harder by the little difference between the outcomes.

One such choice is what thread size to converge to? Long threads
better show the evolution of the topics during a long conversation,
but breaking threads where the topics change radically results in a
more usable heap. I prefer the latter. What do you think?

I can't say anything wise.

I would leave most threads as they are if we don't have a very radical
topic change (especially a hh-ums change).

Later we can discuss a few interesting threads and what to do with
them when I have a greater experience in "heaping".

OK, I think we can go with this. Right now, I'm busy cleaning up my Inbox,
but I'll soon resume cleaning up the heap.
