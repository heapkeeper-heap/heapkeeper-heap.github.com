<pre class="postbody">I have changed Section's is_flat option. Previously, a section could
be either threaded or flat for the values False and True,
respectively. Now there are three types: threaded (the default), flat
and a new type, minimal. A minimal section only displays the root of
each thread that has at least one post in the section.

Question is: where should I put it? I don't want to push it to master
right away, and somehow I don't really feel like creating a branch --
this change doesn't seem significant enough for that.

</span></span>If you don't want to push it to the master, I think it is OK to create
a new branch. Although you can make an "experimental" branch, where
you put all the small changes in which you are uncertain, and when I
review them and we talk through them, we can make the modifications in
the "experimental" branch and merge it into "master".

<pre class="postbody">OK, I pushed it. But there was a problem: I made my changes to master,
then committed them to the new branch (minimal), then pushed both
master and minimal, without pulling master first. (At least that's
what I think.)

Doesn't really matter, the result is again a labyrinth. Sorry for that.
