<pre class="post-body-content">Steps to reproduce:
- clone a repository at the current _master
  (d8012d74c6c9973a4f600009df4bc17f44c8b224)
- add a hk.cfg
- start Hk

<span class="raw-block">    $ src/hk.py
    Warning: post directory does not exists: "hh-mail/posts"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "src/hk.py", line 39, in &lt;module&gt;
        hkshell.main(cmdl_options, args)
      File "/data/lab/hk/hk-dirbug/src/hkshell.py", line 1818, in main
        options.config, options.postdb = read_postdb(cmdl_options.configfile)
      File "/data/lab/hk/hk-dirbug/src/hkshell.py", line 1706, in read_postdb

        os.mkdir(heap_dir)
    OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'hh-mail/posts'
    $
</span>
The lack of the first post directory gets reported first as a warning, then as
an exception. After this, the program exits.

<pre class="post-body-content">To add some weirdness to this bug, if you create the missing directory:

<span class="raw-block">    $ mkdir -p hh-mail/posts

    Warning: post directory does not exists: "xyz-mail"
    Post directory has been created.

    HTML directory has been created.

    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</span>
the post directory for the other heap specified in the hk.cfg file gets created
and the program starts.

<pre class="post-body-content">Heapkeeper thinks that the post directory and HTML directory you
specified in the config file should be there, but if it is not there,
it will only issue a warning and then create it. The rationale behind
this is that this is probably what you want, but maybe you made a typo
in the config file and wanted to use an existing directory, so the
warning will warn you.

The exception you show can be considered a bug though. I think it is
because Heapkeeper just does an "mkdir" instead of "mkdir -p" when it
tries to create the post directory and the HTML directory, so if the
parent directories of those don't exist, the exception will be thrown.

What do you think would be the best behaviour? Don't ever create the
directory on the user's behalf and issue always an error message, or
create it with "-p", or try to create without "-p" and issue an error
only when that fails?

That's a likely explanation.

Let's see the gains and losses in the two cases. User A wants to use a
directory that is not yet there, e.g. after doing a clean install and creating
a hk.cfg without creating the necessary directories by hand. This may be the
case of someone who follows the tutorial improperly and skips the step where
the directory is created. User B, on the other hand wants to use a directory
which is already there, but made a typo.

With auto-creation on:
- User A: feels happy when finds out the directory has been created; thinks
  it's a mature product to handle unexpected situations so gracefully; starts
  using the program as if nothing happened,
- User B: finds out that she made a mistake, and notices that the program tried
  to act intelligently, though this will cost her extra effort; she does a
  'q()', removes the directory, corrects the hk.cfg, and launches Hk again.

With auto-creation off:
- User A: finds out that the directory is missing; though admits she made a
  mistake, she secretly wished the program would take the initiative and create
  the directory anyway; since the program exited anyway, the only thing she has
  to to is to create the directory, and launch again,
- User B: notices the mistake and corrects it, then launches Hk again; may even
  cross her mind that the program saved her a bit of effort by not creating the
  directory (though not very likely).

So, by enabling auto-creation, User A gets spared a small effort (an "mkdir"),
while User B does to do an extra "rm -r"; this is about the same effort.
However, User A might be a newcomer, someone who just gives the tutorial a try.
I think we should pay attention to favoring her particular group, since if they
give up early, we will never have any users.

So considering this I would be in favor of creating the directory...

The problem with "mkdir -p" is that Python doesn't support it out of the box!
Though it wouldn't be that difficult to implement it -- thinking something like
splitting at slashes, then for each part, add current to path_so_far then
create path_so_far. This is a single loop, but it can fail on systems where
there's a limit on maximum directory depth.

And there's always the 3rd option: ask the user. Do we want to do it?

<span class="raw-block">    $ mkdir heap-pots
    $ src/hk.py
    Post directory "heap-pots" does not exist. Create it [y/n]?
</span>
We do this at only one place, when the user does a &lt;C-d&gt; at the prompt. This
could indeed be a slippery slope, at the bottom of which we end up asking the
user about everything. The real threat, however, is that such questions may
make scripts break. This is why tools include a "silent mode", which, in our
case, could be invoked by the "--noshell" switch. However, this could lead to
more code, more opportunity for things to break etc.

...but most Unix tools would just fail with an error message and do nothing.

Maybe I'll take the lazy approach here (which is very often the same as the
KISS principle), and vote against auto-creating directories.

Not true [1]:

<span class="raw-block">    os.makedirs(path[, mode]):

        Recursive directory creation function. Like mkdir(), but makes
        all intermediate-level directories needed to contain the leaf
        directory.
